The implied potential for conflict is grounded in the fact that all major rivers in Central Asia are transboundary. Increasing water scarcity due to unsustainable use and uneven distribution has already led to tensions. Some examples include: conflict between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on the one side and Kyrgyzstan on the other side about the amount and timing of water discharge from the Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan; between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan on the water discharge from the Tuyamuyun reservoir and the water diversion into the Karakum canal; and between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan about the construction of the Rogun dam. Therefore, and rather unsurprisingly, water is generally perceived by policy makers to be closely linked to regional stability and security and hence an issue of high politics (e.g. Horsman 2001; UNDP 2003a; UNEP et al. 2005). But water management is not only a security issue; the region’s most sincere environmental challenges are also linked to water. The most striking and well-known example is the shrinking Aral Sea: since the 1960s, it has lost 90 per cent of its water volume, leading to catastrophic consequences for the regional environment, economy and human health (Giese 1998; Micklin 2006; Sehring 2007). While oil and gas resources in Central Asia are certainly important for the economic development of the region, high quality land and water are key to the survival of a population which for the most part is living on subsistence agriculture. There is a need to take stock of what is being done to address these serious challenges. The first section of this chapter gives an overview of the state of water availability and use in Central Asia and presents approaches that are currently being undertaken at the regional and national level to meet the challenges. The second section is devoted to EU activities in this field, in particular the EU Water Initiative (EUWI) and the water dimension of the EU Central Asia (EU-CAS) Strategy. © 2011 Alexander Warkotsch.","","","","","","","","","Bucknell J., Klytchnikova I., Lampietti J., Lundell M., Scatasta M., Thurman M., Irrigation in Central Asia.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union several disagreements about water usage due to different usage priorities developed. As the energy system of the Soviet Union disappeared, the upper riparian states began to use more water from the reservoirs for hydro energy production in winter instead storing it for irrigation purposes at the lower reaches in summer. Further there are a couple of new irrigation projects that are leading to greater water withdrawal of one state on the costs of the other riparian owners and the dying Aral Sea. The most important conflicts are between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan as well as Kazakhstan at the Syrdarja concerning the use of the Toktogul reservoir; between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan about the amount of water withdrawal in the Karakum and Tujamujun canals as well as the new constructed Golden Century lake; and between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as Turkmenistan at the Amudarja because of the plans for building the Rogun dam. Although regional institutions have been set up to regulate the water courses, they don't work effectively due to mutual distrust of the republics and the threat of conflicts persists.","","Asia; Central Asia; Eurasia; Riparia; conflict management; transboundary cooperation; water management; water use","","","","","","","Babaev A.G., Kirsta B.T., Einige Aspekte der komplizierten ökologischen Situation im Priaral, Serie Geographie, 4, pp. 89-95, (1991); Borovskij V.M., Die Austrocknung des Aralsees und ihre Folgen, Serie Geographic, 5, pp. 35-44, (1978); Giese E., Bahro G., Betke D., Umweltzerstörungen in Trockengebieten Zentralasiens (West- Und Ost-Turkestan).

Before the reforms, agriculture in this region was better developed than the manufacturing industry; this is no longer the case. The main crop grown on the irrigated land of the region is rice. Inefficient distribution of cultivated areas, their excessive use, and the growing volume of fertilizers used in the soil increases the salinization of the soil on arable land. This necessitates the investigation of the soil on irrigated land through environmental and geographical monitoring. This research analyzes the current reclamation state of irrigated cultivated land in the Kyzylorda Region located in the Kazakhstani part of the Eastern Aral Sea region, in the lower reaches of the Syr Darya River. The causes and level of soil salinization in said areas were determined. In addition, the factors that affect land salinization in the Shieli-Zhanakorgan, Kyzylorda, and Kazaly-Aral irrigation sectors were determined. The research classifies the arable land in the Shieli, Zhalagash, Karmakshy, Kazaly, and Aral Districts in terms of salinization type, characterizes its peculiarities, and investigates ways of improving the salt regime of soil on irrigated arable land. © 2016 Toktaganova & Karlikhanov.","Agriculture; Cultivation; Irrigated land; Salinization level; Salt regime of soil","","","","","","","","Kyzylorda: Statistics Book for 2010-2014, (2015); Golovanov A.I., Koshkarov S.I., Regulating the Hydro-Chemical Regime of Landscapes in the Lower Reaches of Syr Darya River, Alatay, (1996); Ibadullayeva S.Z., Sauytbayeva G.Z., Auezova N.A., Toktaganova G.B., Ungarbayeva G.R., The Halophyte Status of the Soil in the Shieli District.

The results show that partial or full market liberalization may result in an increase in water use. However, the greater message is that non-water policies can have a major impact on water outcomes and therefore should be considered in any discussions of water sector reform.","","Asia; Eurasia; Uzbekistan; West Asia; Gossypium hirsutum; Biochemical oxygen demand; Commerce; International trade; Water management; Water supply; agricultural policy; cotton; global economy; irrigation; liberalization; water supply; water use; World Trade Organization; Agricultural policies; Agricultural water use; Aral seas; Downstream impacts; Global economies; Market liberalizations; Potential impacts; Uzbekistan; Water policies; Water sector reforms; Water use; World trade organizations; Water resources","","","","","","","Akhmedov T., National Agricultural Policy in Macro-Economical Framework, Report, (2002); Antonov V., Water resources of Uzbekistan as an integral part of common Aral Sea basin water resources from the perspective of their present and future uses, Water Resources, Aral Sea Problems and Environment, pp. 19-39, (2000); Chapagain A.K., Hoekstra A.Y., Savenije H.H.G., Gautam R., The Water Footprint of Cotton Consumption, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 18, (2005); Djalalov S., Tendencies in Uzbekistan Farm Production, Review, (2001); Dukhovniy V.A., Sokolov V.I., Lessons on cooperation building to manage water conflicts in the Aral Sea Basin, Technical Documents in Hydrology, (2002); Fertilizer Use By Crop in Uzbekistan, (2003); de Fraiture C., Integrated water and food analysis at the global and basin level, An Application of WATERSIM, (2006); Khan M.A., Extension and Training, (1996); Mirzaev S.Sh., Problems of Aral Sea: Causes and solutions, Proceedings of Conference on Aral Sea Problem, (1996); Sirajiddinov N., Kasimova S., Development of rural entrepreneurship, Journal of Economical Review, 5, pp. 21-22, (2001); Spoor M., Transition, Institutions and the Rural Sector, (2003)","","","","","","","","","13600648","","IJWDD","","English","Int.

The main objective of this study was to identify techniques that enable rapid estimation of soil salinity. Therefore, bulk electrical conductivity of the soil (ECa-meas) was measured with three different devices (2P, 4P, and CM-138) and electrical conductivity of the soil paste (ECp-meas) was measured with the so-called 2XP device. These measurements were compared with independent estimates of ECa-calc and ECp-calc based on laboratory measurements of the saturated extract, ECe, of soil samples from the same sites. Soil salinity could be assessed satisfactorily with all four devices. ECp-meas could be well reproduced by the 2XP device (R2=0.76), whereas ECa-meas estimates using 2P, 4P, and CM-138 in the field were less accurate (R2<0.50). The sensitivity of all devices to the main ions Cl- and Ca2+ suggests that the measuring principles are similar for all instruments. The devices can therefore be used interchangeably. Field assessment of soil salinity was considerably enhanced by the use of CM-138, because large areas can be quickly assessed, which may be desirable in spite of the lower accuracy. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Electrical conductivity; Regression tree; Salinity assessment","Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; Khorazm; Uzbekistan; West Asia; Degradation; Electric conductivity; Salinity measurement; Sampling; Soil surveys; Degradation; Electric conductivity; Salinity measurement; Sampling; electrical conductivity; salinization; sensitivity analysis; soil chemistry; spatial distribution; Salinity assessment; Soil salinity; Soil surveys","","","","","German Ministry for Education and Research; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (0339970A)","Acknowledgements This study was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF; project number 0339970A).","Abdullaev U., Republic of Uzbekistan.

Multi-temporal Landsat 5 data combined with GW levels and potentials, elevation and relative topographic position, and soil (clay content) parameters, were used for modelling bulk electromagnetic induction (EMI) at the end of the irrigation season. Random forest (RF) regressionwas applied to predict in situ observations of 2008–2011 which originated from a cotton research station in Uzbekistan. Validation, i.e. median statistics from 100 RF runs with a holdout of each 20% of the samples, revealed that mono-temporal (R2: 0.1–0.18, RMSE: 16.7–24.9 mSm−1) underperformed multi-temporal RS data (R2: 0.29–0.45; RMSE: 15.1–20.9 mSm−1). Combinations of multi-temporal RS data with environmental parameters achieved highest accuracies (R2: 0.36–0.50, RMSE: 13.2–19.9 mSm−1). Beside RS data recorded at the initial peaks of the major irrigation phases, terrain and GW parameters turned out to be important variables for the model. RF preferred neither raw data nor spectral indices known to be suitable for detecting soil salinity. Unexplained variance components result from missing environmental variables, but also from processes not considered in the data. A calibration of the EMI for electrical conductivity and the standard soil salinity classification returned an overall accuracy of 76–83% for the period 2008–2011. The presented indirect approach together with the in situ calibration of the EMI data can support an accuratemapping of soil salinity at the end of the season, at least in the type of irrigation systems found in the ASB. © 2019, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformation (DGPF) e.V.","Electromagnetic induction; Environmental parameters; Irrigated agriculture; Landsat; Multi-temporal; Soil salinity","Uzbekistan; calibration; groundwater resource; in situ test; Landsat thematic mapper; parameter estimation; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery","","","","","Volkswagen Foundation, (88506)","This research is a part of the joint project “Assessing Land Value Changes and Developing a Discussion-Support-Tool for Improved Land Use Planning in the Irrigated Lowlands of Central Asia” (LaVaCCA), funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (Az. 88506).","Abbas A., Khan S., Using remote sensing techniques for appraisal of irrigated soil salinity, Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making Land, Water and Environmental Management: Integrated Systems for Sustainability MODSIM07, pp. 2632-2638, (2007); Abrol I.P., Yadav J.S.P., Massoud F.I., Salt-affected soils and their management, FAO Soils Bulletin, 39, (1988); AghaKouchak A., Farahmand A., Remote sensing of drought: progress, challenges and opportunities, Rev Geophys, 53, pp. 452-480, (2015); Akramkhanov A., Vlek P.L.G., The assessment of spatial distribution of soil salinity risk using neural network, Environ Monit Assess, 184, 4, pp. 2475-2485, (2012); Akramkhanov A., Sommer R., Martius C., Hendrickx J.M.H., Vlek P.L.G., Comparison and sensitivity of measurement techniques for spatial distribution of soil salinity, Irrig Drain Syst, 22, 1, pp. 115-126, (2008); Akramkhanov A., Martius C., Park S.J., Hendrickx J.M.H., Environmental factors of spatial distribution of soil salinity on flat irrigated terrain, Geoderma, 163, 1-2, pp. 55-62, (2011); Akramkhanov A., Kuziev R., Sommer R., Martius C., Forkutsa O., Massucati L., Soils and soil ecology in Khorezm, Cotton, Water, Salts and Soums: Economic and Ecological Restructuring in Khorezm, pp. 37-58, (2012); Akramkhanov A., Brus D.J., Walvoort D.J.J., Geostatistical monitoring of soil salinity in Uzbekistan by repeated EMI surveys, Geoderma, 213, pp. 600-607, (2014); Allbed A., Kumar L., Soil salinity mapping and monitoring in arid and semi-arid regions using remote sensing technology: a review, Adv Remote Sens, 2, pp. 373-385, (2013); Asfaw E., Suryabhagavan K.V., Argaw M., Soil salinity modeling and mapping using remote sensing and GIS: the case of Wonji Sugar Cane Irrigation Farm, Ethiopia.

This model is used to formalize the structure of information and its life cycle, simulate processing processes, formalize the impact on information and the movement of information, taking into account the factors of adaptation of the EMIS to the structure of subject activity. Working with information allows you to process information processes and implement them in algorithmic, software and theoretical-analytical analysis. The presented information processing processes scheme is used to formalize information flows in the ecological monitoring information system. The aim of the study is that agricultural production is under heavy pressure based on world population growth and significant changes in climate. This study discusses the concept of digital agricultural practices and their impact on agricultural productivity. The assessment of the current situation is carried out by digitization in agricultural areas located in the Aral Sea region. The methodology is used in this study as a method to assess the current state of digital applications for agriculture in the Aral Sea region. Agriculture is one of the most suitable methods for it, as digitalization is still in its infancy in the Aral Sea region. Digital agricultural technologies in the Aral Sea region are at an early stage of development, and the topics discussed in the world are aimed at making significant progress in raising awareness about farmers and other sectors of agriculture in the Aral Sea region. Although the current penetration of digital technologies is not large enough in terms of volume and quantity, the analysis of the methods used for agriculture can achieve the expected results as a result of the experience of developed countries.  © 2021 IEEE.","datalogical model; ecological monitoring; infor-mation security; information processing; mathematical model; sensor","Agriculture; Ecology; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Monitoring; Population statistics; Security of data; Algorithmics; Analytical analysis; Aral Sea; Datalogical model; Ecological monitoring; Infor-mation security; Information process; Monitoring information system; Process information; Process schemes; Productivity","","","","","","","Kabulov A., Urunbayev E., Ashurov A., Logic method of finding maximum joint subsystems of systems of boolean equations, 2020 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies, Icisct, (2020); Kabulov A., Urunbaev E., Ashurov A., On functions correcting the sets of incorrect algorithms, 2020 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies, Icisct, (2020); Kabulov A., Normatov I., Seytov A., Kudaybergenov A., Optimal management of water resources in large main canals with cascade pumping stations, Iemtronics 2020-International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, Proceedings; Kabulov A., Saymanov I., Yarashov I., Muxammadiev F., Algorithmic method of security of the internet of things based on steganographic coding, Ieee International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, Iemtronics 2021-Proceedings, (2021); Kabulov A.V., Normatov I.H., Karimov A., Algorithmization control of complex systems based on functioning tables, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1441, 1; Kabulov A., Normatov I., Urunbaev E., Ashurov A., About the problem of minimal tests searching, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 12, pp. 10419-10430; Kabulov A., Normatov I., Karimov A., Navruzov E., Algorithm of constructing control models of complex systems in the language of functioning tables, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 12, pp. 10397-10417; Kabulov A.V., Urunbaev E., Normatov I., Ashurov A., Synthesis methods of optimal discrete corrective functions, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 9, pp. 6467-6482; Kabulov A., Urunbayev E., Ashurov A., Logical method for constructing the optimal corrector of fuzzy heuristic algorithms, Ternational Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies: Applications Trends and Opportunities Icisct, (2019)","A.

Hydropower is one of the most promising renewable sources with immense potential to increase the installed energy capacity in Southeast and Central Asia. Clean energy, minimal losses during the conversion process and the enormous supply of this energy source suggest hydropower as the new bonanza for the two regions. The upstream countries in the Aral Sea Basin of CA - Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan - and the upstream countries in the Mekong Basin of MSEA - Laos, Cambodia and Yunnan Province of the People’s Republic of China - are nowadays acknowledged as storage batteries for those regions and beyond. China is developing the hydropower potential of its territorial share of the Upper Mekong Basin and, in exchange, is sharing the energy produced by other countries in the Basin. It is also involved in hydropower projects in both regions. However, there are major concerns about increasing hydropower capacity at the expense of environmental goods and services that support the economies and livelihoods of large populations in both regions. There is also concern about conflicts between the energy sector and other sectors, especially agriculture and fisheries. Moreover, there is a major concern over the skewed distribution of the economic benefits emerging from hydropower energy in favour of China, as the most powerful country straddling Mainland Southeast Asia and Central Asia, as well as in favour of other more powerful or more advantageously located countries in these regions. This study assesses the potential and identifies the challenges of hydropower development in the Mekong Basin of Mainland Southeast Asia and the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia. This is a first attempt to investigate the Mekong and the Aral Sea Basins jointly with respect to hydropower development. © Stella Tsani and Indra Overland 2021.","","","","","","","","","Abdullaev I., Wegerich K., Kazbekov J., History of water management in the Aral Sea Basin, The Aral Sea Basin: Water for Sustainable Development in Central Asia, pp. 8-24, (2020); Ahmadzai S., McKinna A., Afghanistan electrical energy and trans-boundary water systems analyses: Challenges and opportunities, Energy Reports, 4, pp. 435-469, (2018); Althor G., Mahood S., Witt B., Et al., Large-scale environmental degradation results in inequitable impacts to already impoverished communities: A case study from the floating villages of Cambodia, Ambio, 47, 7, pp. 747-759, (2018); Amrith S., Unruly Waters: How Mountain Rivers and Monsoons Have Shaped South Asia’s History, (2018); Anthony E.J., Brunier G., Besset M., Et al., Linking rapid erosion of the Mekong River delta to human activities, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Araral E., Wang Y., Water governance 2.0: A review and second generation research agenda, Water Resources Management, 27, 11, pp. 3945-3957, (2013); Aroonrat K., Wongwises S., Current status and potential of hydro energy in Thailand: A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 46, pp. 70-78, (2015); The Greater Mekong Subregion Atlas of the Environment, (2012); Tajikistan, Uzbekistan to build two joint hydropower plants, (2020); Baumgartner L.J., Barlow C., Mallen-Cooper M., Et al., Achieving fish passage outcomes at irrigation infrastructure: A case study from the Lower Mekong Basin, Aquaculture and Fisheries, 6, 2, pp. 113-124, (2021); Baybagyshov E., Degembaeva N., Analysis of usage of the renewable energy in Kyrgyzstan, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 249, (2019); Kyrgyzstan election: PM quits as protesters take control in Kyrgyzstan, (2020); Berga L., The role of hydropower in climate change mitigation and adaptation: A review, Engineering, 2, 3, pp. 313-318, (2016); Biba S., China’s Hydro-politics in the Mekong, (2018); Calabria F.A., Camanho A.S., Zanella A., The use of composite indicators to evaluate the performance of Brazilian hydropower plants, International Transactions in Operational Research, 25, pp. 1323-1343, (2018); Chala G.T., Ma'Arof M.I.N., Sharma R., Trends in an increased dependence towards hydropower energy utilization-a short review, Cogent Engineering, 6, 1, (2019); Chea R., Grenouillet G., Lek S., Evidence of water quality degradation in Lower Mekong Basin revealed by self-organizing map, PLoS One, 11, 1, (2016); Cheang V., Water resource security in Mainland Southeast Asia, Collaboration in Water Resource Management in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, pp. 15-34, (2020); Clarke M., The Belt and Road Initiative: China’s new grand strategy, Asia Policy, 24, pp. 71-79, (2017); Dikambaev S., Draft National Sustainable Energy Action Plan of the Kyrgyz Republic, (2019); Djanibekova N., Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan exchange land in historic settlement, Eurasianet.org, (2019); Djumaboev K., Anarbekov O., Holmatov B., Et al., Surface water resources, The Aral Sea Basin: Water for Sustainable Development in Central Asia, pp. 25-39, (2020); Dugan P.J., Barlow C., Agostinho A.A., Et al., Fish migration, dams, and loss of ecosystem services in the Mekong basin, Ambio, 39, 4, pp. 344-348, (2010); There is water in them hills, The Economist, (2014); The Economist, (2020); Eder T.S., Mardell J., Powering the Belt and Road: China supports its energy companies’ global expansion and prepares the ground for potential new supply chains, (2019); In-Depth Energy Efficiency Review, (2013); Investment Climate and Market Structure Review in the Energy Sector of Kazakhstan, (2013); Eshchanov B., Abylkasymova A., Aminjonov F., Et al., Hydropower potential of the Central Asia Countries, Central Asia Regional Data Review, 19, pp. 1-7, (2019); Hydro power requires $100 bn investment annually, (2020); Friend R.M., Arthur R.I., Overplaying overfishing: A cautionary tale from the Mekong, Society and Natural Resources, 25, 3, pp. 285-301, (2012); Gassner K., Merle-Beral E., Terenteva O., Et al., Small hydro power plant in the Kyrgyz Republic: Assessment of potential and development challenges, (2017); Gopalan S., Rajan R.S., Has foreign aid been effective in the water supply and sanitation sector?

Agroclimatic zoning of a territory is one of the most important parameters of agroclimatic support of the economy; however, the problem of creating modern specialized maps on this topic and updating climate standards in Russia and Kazakhstan remains. Regional studies of the last few years on climatology and adaptation of agriculture to climate warming directly or indirectly indicate the need for updating climate standards and reference material (maps, diagrams, textbooks, etc.). In the course of this study, the sum of active temperatures (ΣT10) was calculated for 270 meteorological stations in Russia, Kazakhstan, and adjacent territories for the 2001–2018 period. The results recorded a noticeable shift in the boundaries of agroclimatic zones and an increase in ΣT10 by 200–600°C depending on the specific territory compared with data from the 1950s–1960s. The agroclimatic zones shifted to the greatest extent to 1600–2200 and 2200–2800°C, but Kamchatka, the Aral Sea region, and the Syr Darya basin are dominant in absolute value. The subtropical zone also expanded significantly beyond the Black Sea coast of Krasnodar krai, the southern coast of the Crimea and the extreme south of the Turkistan Region. The above information partially confirmed the forecast of Roshydromet in 2005, although in many regions of Russia the trend for ΣT10 to increase was slightly weaker than expected. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","agroclimatic zones; climate warming; subtropical zone; sum of active temperatures; updating of climate maps","Aral Sea; Black Sea; Kamchatka; Kazakhstan; Krasnodar; Russian Federation; Sirdaryo; Turkestan; Uzbekistan; agrometeorology; climate change; climatology; subtropical region; territory","","","","","","","Zoidze E.K., Khomyakova T.V., Shostak Z.A., Sirotenko V.G., Ovcharenko L.I., Sukhareva V.A., On the problem of adequate agroclimatic support of the economy of the Russian Federation in conditions of climate change, Meteorol.

Over a few decades, beginning in the 1970s, the sea’s continued desiccation has led to soil salinisation resulting in desertification of the sea basin, salt storms and loss of biodiversity, as well as to significant deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the Aral Sea region. The chapter identifies the priority areas for the Aral Sea Basin Programmes aimed at improving the situation with water and its uses, agriculture and energy generation and consumption. It analyses the projects involving local, regional, national and international bodies, as well as private and public entities, and delineates how the water, food and energy interdependencies in the Aral Sea Basin have negatively affected livelihoods in the local area. The chapter further shows progression in the application of relational equity to the nexus governance in the Aral Sea area during the implementation of three programmes. It argues that relational equity management sets a framework that permits better and faster achievement of the nexus governance goals. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Anastasia Koulouri and Nikolai Mouraviev; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Abdullaev I., Rakhmatullaev S., Setting up the agenda for water reforms in Central Asia: Does the nexus approach help?, Environmental Earth Sciences, 75, 10, (2016); Beglov I.F., Central Asia Regional Water Information Base-CAREWIB, Water and Food Security in Central Asia, (2011); Bosch K., Erdinger L., Ingel F., Khussainova S., Utegenova E., Bresgen N., Eckl P., Evaluation of the toxicological properties of ground- and surface-water samples from the Aral Sea Basin, The Science of the Total Environment, 374, 1, pp. 43-50, (2007); Cai X., McKinney D.C., Rosengrant M.W., Sustainability analysis for irrigation water management in the Aral Sea region, Agricultural Systems, 76, 3, pp. 1043-1066, (2003); Cai X., Rosengrant M., McKinney D., Ringler C., Holistic Water Resources-Economic Modeling, World Water and Environmental Resources Congress, (2001); Carley M., Christie I., Managing Sustainable Development, (2000); Dukhovny V.A., The Future of the Amu Darya Basin in the Context of Climate Change, (2018); Elliff C., Kikuchi R., The ecosystem service approach and its application as a tool for integrated coastal management, Natureza & Conservafdo, 13, 2, pp. 105-111, (2015); Endo A., Tsurita I., Burnett K., Orencio P., A review of the current state of research on the water, energy, and food nexus, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 11, pp. 20-30, (2017); Fisher blooming in Kazakhstan, Energyprom, (2017); Catalyzing Change: A Handbook for Developing Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Water Efficiency Strategies, (2004); About IWRM, (2018); History, (2019); Horinkova V., Abdullaev I., Institutional aspects of water management in Central Asia: Water users associations, Water International, 28, 2, pp. 237-245, (2003); Hornidge A.K., Oberkircher L., Tischbein B., Schorcht G., Bhaduri A., Manschadi A.M., Reconceptualising water management in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, Natural Resources Forum, 35, 4, pp. 251-268, (2011); Hornidge A.K., Oberkircher L., Tischbein B., Schorcht G., Bhaduri A., Awan U., Manschadi A.M., Reconceptualising Water Management in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, Integrated Water Resources Management: Concept, Research and Implementation, (2016); Karther D., Abdullaev I., Boldgiv B., Borchardt D., Chalov S., Jarsjo J., Nittrouer J.A., Water in Central Asia: An integrated assessment for science-based management, Environmental Earth Sciences, 79, (2017); Karther D., Chalov S., Borchardt D., Water resources and their management in central Asia in the early twenty first century: Status, challenges and future prospects, Environmental Earth Sciences, 73, 2, pp. 487-499, (2015); Kosarev A., Kostianoy A.G., Introduction, The Aral Sea Environment, (2010); Kubo H., Tateno K., Watanabe A., Kato Y., Human and environmental symbiosis in Central Asia: Through the water management of the Aral Sea Basin crisis, Transition Studies Review, 16, 2, pp. 467-478, (2009); Lenton R., Muller M., Integrated Water Resources Management in Practice: Better Water Management for Development, (2009); Libert B., Orolbaev E., Steklov Y., Water and energy crisis in Central Asia, China Eurasia Forum, 6, 3, pp. 9-20, (2008); Martius C.H., Lamers J., Wehrheim P., Schoeller-Schletter A., Eshchanov R., Tupitsa A., Khamzina A., Akramkhanov A., Vlek P., Developing sustainable land and water management for the Aral Sea Basin through an interdisciplinary research.

At present, approximately 70% of the area in this study region is sown to irrigated cotton and winter wheat under the so-called state mandate. We present evidence of the benefits of moving away from this approach toward more diversified farming with an increasing area of alternative crops in the selected region. We report on a series of studies that included a) crop suitability screening based on secondary data, b) joint farmer experiments, and c) a mathematical simulation model with the overarching objective to assess potential benefits and constraints for crop diversification. The findings of this long-term, multiyear, and multidisciplinary approach show that greater crop diversity can increase water use efficiency, and secure farm income in dryland areas prone to water scarcity and soil salinity. In addition, the findings of the simulation model confirmed that crop diversification could secure income of downstream farmers during the climate-driven decline in water availability. Overall, the findings indicate that greater crop diversity and improved access to markets can lead to a sustainable development path in the region. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aral Sea Basin; Climate change; Diversification; Food security; Simpson index; Water shortage","","","","","","","","Ali M., Lumpkin T.A., Farooq U., Vegetable research and development in Central Asia: A guideline for setting priorities under data scarcity, Vegetable production in Central Asia: Status and perspectives, pp. 13-14, (2005); Begdullaeva T., Kienzler K.M., Kan E., Ibragimov N., Lamers J.P.A., Response of Sorghum bicolor varieties to soil salinity for feed and food production in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan, Irrigation and Drainage Systems, 21, pp. 237-250, (2007); Bekchanov M.B., Kan E., Lamers J.P.A., Options of agricultural extension provision for rural development in Central Asian transition economies: The case of Uzbekistan, pp. 72-83, (2009); Bobojonov I., Modeling crop and water allocation under uncertainty in irrigated agriculture: A case Study on the Khorezm Region, (2008); Bobojonov I., Franz J., Berg E., Lamers J.P.A., Martius C., Improved Policy making for sustainable farming: A Case study on irrigated dryland agriculture in western Uzbekistan, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, 34, pp. 800-817, (2010); Bobojonov I., Lamers J.P.A., Analysis of agricultural markets in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, Continuity and change: Land and water use reforms in rural Uzbekistan.

The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship of the two rivers feeding Uzbekistan to the water inflow into the Aral Sea and to economic productivity in agriculture. We find that because water consumption exceeds water formation, the prognosis for future growth in agricultural output is at risk. Uzbekistan and its neighbors need to address the upstream and downstream rights to water access for the Syr and Amu rivers. The solutions to our immediate problems can be found inside Uzbekistan.

Although the assessment of heavy metal contents is vital to develop and design sustainable water management plans, several areas in Central Asia such as Kazakhstan do not have recent studies available that evaluate this situation. One representative example of this lack of information is the Syr Darya River. Thus, this study carried out the first approach to a water quality assessment in Kazakhstan's Syr Darya River, where a massive expansion of irrigation canals, pastures in middle- and lower-reaches and an increase in industrialization and population have lowered its potential water capacity. To achieve this goal, various physicochemical parameters were analyzed for forty-three water samples along the river under dry weather conditions at 25 cm water depth. The obtained results were analyzed using standard methods (e.g., Multi N/C 2100 S analyzer or an atomic absorption spectrometer) and evaluated by multivariate techniques (cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NDMS)) and a heavy metal pollution index (HPI). In the CA, five cluster groups were obtained. It is important to remark that the first cluster consists of the highest number of water sampling points (8). The last cluster is made up of only one point, which shows the highest difference against the other sites in our model. The NDMS also confirmed that some specific points along the river are different. Five components were extracted from the PCA: (1) COD (chemical oxygen demand), Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Mn; (2) Cu, Cd, Ni and Co; (3) T (water temperature), pH and DO (dissolved oxygen); (4) T and Fe; and (5) COD and OC (organic carbon). The HPI showed very high values (279.9), which were locally confirmed in some hotspots close to the Aral Sea, industrialized areas and agricultural fields. Therefore, our results demonstrate that, under dry weather conditions, surface water resources could be mismanaged in the Syr Darya River in Kazakhstan in specific areas. For the future, considering the important role that agriculture and pasture play in the Kazakh economy, we insist upon the importance of applying water quality control measures applying nature-based solutions and efficient management plans. Moreover, we confirmed the necessity to conduct further research related to sampling under other weather situations such as wet and cold conditions, different river water depths and other locations considering specific land uses, for example, grazing, mining, railways or industries. © 2017 by the authors.","Heavy metals; Kazakhstan; Multivariate techniques; Syr Darya River; Water conservation","Aral Sea; Central Asia; Kazakhstan; Syr Darya River; Agriculture; Biochemical oxygen demand; Cluster analysis; Dissolved oxygen; Economics; Heavy metals; Importance sampling; Iron compounds; Irrigation canals; Land use; Manganese removal (water treatment); Meteorology; Nickel; Organic carbon; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Rivers; Surface water resources; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Atomic absorption spectrometers; Kazakhstan; Multivariate techniques; Non-metric multidimensional scaling; Physicochemical parameters; Sustainable water management; Water quality assessments; assessment method; climate conditions; heavy metal; human activity; identification method; industrialization; information; land management; multivariate analysis; physicochemical property; river pollution; sampling; sustainability; water management; water planning; water quality; River pollution","","","","","Training Program for Youth Innovative Talents in Science and Technology in Xinjiang, (QN2016BS0052); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U1603242); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (2017-XBQNXZ-B-012)","Funding: This research was funded and supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1603242), the Training Program for Youth Innovative Talents in Science and Technology in Xinjiang (QN2016BS0052) and CAS “Light of West China” Program (2017-XBQNXZ-B-012).","Ahearn D.S., Sheibley R.W., Dahlgren R.A., Anderson M., Johnson J., Tate K.W., Land use and land cover influence on water quality in the last free-flowing river draining the western Sierra Nevada, California, J.

With its food security depending almost entirely on irrigated agriculture, Central Asia is one of the arid regions highly vulnerable to water scarcity. Previous research of land and water use in the region has focused on improving water-use efficiency, soil management and identifying technical, institutional and agricultural innovations. However, vulnerability to climate change has rarely been considered, in spite of the imminent risks due to a higher-than-average warming perspective and the predicted melting of glaciers, which will greatly affect the availability of irrigation water. Using the Khorezm region in the irrigated lowlands of northwest Uzbekistan as an example, we identify the local patterns of vulnerability to climate variability and extremes. We look at on-going environmental degradation, water-use inefficiency, and barriers to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and based on an extensive review of research evidence from the region, we present concrete examples of initiatives for building resilience and improving climate risk management. These include improving water use efficiency and changing the cropping patterns that have a high potential to decrease the exposure and sensitivity of rural communities to climate risks. In addition, changes in land use such as the afforestation of degraded croplands, and introducing resource-smart cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, may strengthen the capacity of farmers and institutions to respond to climate challenges. As these can be out-scaled to similar environments, i.e. the irrigated cotton and wheat growing lowland regions in Central Asia and the Caucasus, these findings may be relevant for regions beyond the immediate geographic area from which it draws its examples. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Aral Sea Basin; Climate risk; Governance; Irrigated agriculture; Transformation countries; Uzbekistan; Vulnerability","Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; soil organic matter; adaptation; afforestation; agricultural worker; agriculture; Asia; climate change; crop; cropland; deglaciation; degradation; ecology; ecosystem; environmental change; food security; government; irrigation (agriculture); plant water use; priority journal; review; rural area; rural population; soil management; Uzbekistan; water availability; water management; water supply","","","","","ZEF; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (0339970A); Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia","This research work was funded by Ca’ Foscari University of Venice .

Options for diversification and its associated drivers might be shaped by livelihood context, and it remains as a general gap in knowledge. This study aimed to reveal the driving factors behind households’ decisions to diversify their crops in different livelihood contexts. This information could be useful to inform stakeholders on a set of context-fitted options for improving natural resources and rural livelihood resilience to climatic variability and risks. This study applied the Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF) to guide surveys and multivariate analyses that identified agricultural livelihood context types at the village level, and also evaluated both the common and type-specific drivers encouraging households to diversify their agricultural production in two rural villages in the Aral Sea region. This study objectively identified three distinct agricultural livelihood types and the main factors differentiating these types from each other. When the total sampled population was analyzed, the results indicated that the agricultural experience of the household heads, levels of education, sources of income, number of cattle and land endowments, and proximity to markets were common and significant drivers in diversifying these households’ crop production. Analyzing the decisions behind diversifying crop production for each agricultural livelihood type revealed type-specific drivers of diversification. The findings suggested that considering both common and type-specific drivers of diversification would allow better understanding of household decisions and provide more insights to develop effective policies promoting climate-smart agriculture through diversification, rather than continuing to use the current “uniform blanket” approach. © 2022 by the authors.","agricultural livelihood system; Aral Sea Basin Region; diversification; household; Karakalpakstan; smallholder","Aral Sea; agricultural development; agricultural diversification; crop production; household energy; livelihood; smallholder","","","","","Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, CGIAR","This research was funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems led by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA).

Large-scale cotton production utilizes the practices of conventional agriculture and has severe environmental consequences in arid regions. Some of these problems, such as salinization, currently exist in Uzbekistan as a result of cotton production and these conventional farming practices. This chapter is a review of cotton production, the environmental consequences of conventional agriculture, and its relationship to the Aral Sea Disaster. Storm water management with biofiltration, sustainable farming practices, efficient irrigation, ecological horticultural practices, and a water conservation program are remedies that can help to reduce the environmental degradation caused by cotton production and restore some of the water resources in Uzbekistan.

We concentrate on studying water security of five countries in the region: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. These countries share the same recent history of being a part of the Soviet Union, and inherit their water regulation from the planned economy of that time that was targeted at maximizing agricultural output through diverting the river flow into an extensive and largely ineffective network of irrigation canals. The current water crisis is largely due to human activity; however the region is also strongly impacted by the climate. Climate change will contribute to water problems, escalating irrigation demand during the drought period, and increasing water loss with evaporation. The future of the countries of the Aral Sea basin then depends on both the regional scenario of water management policy and a global scenario of climate change, and is integrated with global socioeconomic scenarios. We formulate a set of regional policy scenarios (""Business as Usual"", ""Falling Behind"" and ""Closing the Gap"") and demonstrate how each of them corresponds to IPCC SRES scenarios, the latter used as an input to the General Circulation Models (GCMs). Then we discuss the relative effectiveness of the introduced scenarios for mitigating water problems in the region, taking into account the adaptation through changing water demand for agriculture. Finally, we introduce the results of multimodel analysis of GCM climate projections, especially in relation to the change in precipitation and frequency of droughts, and discuss the impact of climate change on future development of the region. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The collapse of the Soviet Union left the issue under the purview of international law. This essay addresses how this shift has affected attempts to slow or reverse the sea's depletion. Treaties on the non-navigation use of international watercourses and on the prevention of desertification have had little effect. While a number of regional instruments and arrangements have been brought to bear, they have also done little to reverse damage to the sea. Finally, attempts to regulate the issue through domestic law, as evidenced in the case of Kyrgyzstan, have done little as well. While some progress has recently been made under the auspices of the World Bank, it is not a result of international law. The conclusion is that the shift from domestic to international law has little improved the situation, and may have made matters worse.","Agriculture; Amu Darya; Aral Sea; Desertification; International law; Irrigation; Syr Darya","Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; Kyrgyzstan; Sirdaryo; USSR; Uzbekistan; West Asia; desertification; disaster management; environmental management; international law; irrigation; Law of the Sea; marine environment; marine policy; World Bank","","","","","","","Akmansoy S., McKinney D.C., Aral Sea Water Rights, (1997); Burns W.C., The International Convention to Combat Desertification: Drawing a line in the sand?, Michigan Journal of International Law, 16, pp. 831-882, (1995); Clark L.C., The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the new partnership for Africa's development, Seattle University Law Review, 27, pp. 525-555, (2003); Danish K.W., International environmental law and the 'bottom up' approach: A review of the Desertification Convention, Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, 3, pp. 133-176, (1995); Elhance A.P., Conflict and cooperation over water in the Aral Sea basin, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 20, pp. 207-218, (1997); Iles A., The Desertification Convention: A deeper focus on social aspects of environmental degradation?, Harvard International Law Journal, 36, pp. 207-219, (1995); Central Asia: Water and Conflict, (2002); The Curse of Cotton: Central Asia's Destructive Monoculture, (2005); Kemelova D., Zhalkubaev G., Water, conflict and regional security in Central Asia revisited, New York University Environmental Law Journal, 11, pp. 479-502, (2003); McCaffrey S.C., Water, water everywhere, but too few drops to drink: The coming fresh water crisis and international environmental law, Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 28, pp. 325-337, (2000); McCaffrey S.C., The Law of International Watercourses: Non-Navigational Uses, (2003); McKinney D.C., Cooperative management of transboundary water resources in Central Asia, In the Tracks of Tamerlane, pp. 187-219, (2004); Mickin P.P., Desiccation of the Aral Sea: A water management disaster in the Soviet Union, Science, 241, pp. 1170-1176, (1988); Peachey E.J., The Aral Sea basin crisis and sustainable water resource management in Central Asia, Journal of Public and International Affairs, 15, pp. 1-20, (2004); Sandbank L., Dirty laundry: Why international measures to save the global clean water supply have failed, Fordham Environmental Law Journal, 13, pp. 165-205, (2001); Seivers E.W., Water, conflict and regional security in Central Asia, New York University Environmental Law Journal, 10, pp. 356-402, (2002); Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, (2008); Status of Ratification and Entry Into Force, (2008); Vinogradov S., Langford V.P.E., Managing transboundary water resources in the Aral Sea basin: In search of a solution, International Journal of Global Environmental Issues, 1, 3, pp. 345-362, (2001); Wegerich K., Not a Simple Path: A Sustainable Future for Central Asia, (2001); Wegerich K., Coping with disintegration of a river-basin management system: Multidimensional issues in Central Asia, Water Policy, 6, pp. 335-344, (2004); Weiss E.B., Internatonal environmental law: Contemporary issues and the emergence of a new world order, Georgetown Law Journal, 81, pp. 675-710, (1992); Innovative approaches to ecosystem restoration: Kazakhstan's Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea Phase I Project, Water Feature Stories, 23, pp. 1-2, (2008)","","","","","","","","","14653354","","","","English","Cent.

Its sparse hydrographic network includes a small number of large rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, many ponds and smaller streams, as well as littoral zones bordering the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. A diverse fisheries sector, initially based on wild fish capture and later including aquaculture, developed in these waters during the Soviet era, when animal agriculture was unable to meet the protein needs of Soviet citizens. The sector, which was originally centered on the Volga–Caspian basin, was tightly managed by Moscow and benefitted from coordinated investments in research, infrastructure, and human resources, as well as policies to increase the consumption of fish products. Independence in 1991 administered a political and economic shock that disrupted these relationships. Kazakhstan’s wild fish harvests plummeted by more than two-thirds, and aquaculture collapsed to just 3% of its previous level. Per capita consumption of fish products also declined, as did processing capacity. Favorable recent policies to define fishing rights, incentivize investments, prevent illegal fishing, and make stocking more effective have helped to reverse these trends and stabilize the sector. Continued recovery will require additional steps to manage water resources sustainably, prioritize the use of water for fish habitats, and minimize the effects of climate change. This comprehensive assessment of Kazakhstan’s fisheries sector over the past century provides the basis to understand how long-term dynamic interactions of the environment with the political economy influence fisheries in Eurasia’s largest country. © 2022 by the authors.

This article examines why Central Asian elites and the international community could not choose the optimal negotiation set for environmental protection when designing postindependence solutions for cooperation. How the negotiation sets were constructed hinged on how issues were linked, added, and subtracted. This article explores the three negotiation sets available to the Central Asian states at independence: a water set; a water and energy set; and a water, energy, and agriculture set. Although the third set was the most environmentally effective, it was not included in the set of feasible solutions for domestic political reasons related to the importance of cotton as a system of social, economic, and political control. Short-term economic and political interests prevented the leaders from shifting agricultural production away from cotton to less water-intensive crops.","","Aral Sea; environmental policy; international cooperation; negotiation process; policy making","","","","","","","Bernauer T., The effect of international environmental institutions: How we might learn more, International Organization, 49, pp. 351-377, (1995); Bohr A., Head of Uzbek Writers' Union criticizes Moscow's economic diktat, Radio Liberty Research, 146, (1988); Caponera D., Legal and Institutional Framework for the Management of the Aral Sea Basin Water Resources, (1995); Craumer P., Rural and Agricultural Development in Uzbekistan, (1995); DeSombre E.R., Kauffman J., The Montreal protocol multilateral fund: Partial success story, Institutions for Environmental Aid, pp. 89-126, (1996); Land Reform and Farm Restructuring Policy Guidelines, (1998); Fox J.A., Brown L.D., The Struggle for Accountability: The World Bank, NGOs, and Grassroots Movements, (1998); Gleason G., Marketization and migration: The politics of cotton in Central Asia, Journal of Soviet Nationalities, 1, pp. 66-98, (1990); Gleason G., The struggle for control over water in Central Asia: Republican sovereignty and collective action, Report on the USSR, 3, pp. 11-19, (1991); Haas P., Keohane R.O., Levy M.A., Institutions for the Earth: Sources of Effective International Environmental Protection, (1993); Ilkhamov A., Shirkats, dekhqon, farmers and others: Farm restructuring in Uzbekistan, Central Asian Survey, 17, 4, pp. 539-560, (1998); Aral: Yesterday and Today: Problems and Perspectives of the Aral Crisis, (1997); Economic Review: Uzbekistan, (1992); Fundamental Provisions of Water Management Strategy in the Aral Sea Basin, (1996); Jones L.P., Weinthal E., Prelude to the resource curse: Oil and gas development strategies in Central Asia and beyond, Comparative Political Studies; Keck M.A., Sikkink K., Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics, (1998); Keohane R.O., After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy, (1984); Keohane R.O., Levy M.A., Institutions for Environmental Aid: Pitfalls and Promise, (1996); Klotzli S., The Water and Soil Crisis in Central Asia-a Source for Future Conflicts?, (1994); Micklin P.P., The Water Management Crisis in Soviet Central Asia, (1991); The Efficient Use of the Naryn-Syr Darya Cascade Water Storage Agreement in Principle, (1997); Mitchell R.B., Compliance theory: An overview, Improving Compliance With International Environmental Law, pp. 3-28, (1996); Pannier B., Idinov N., Kyrgyzstan/Kazakhstan: Water used as leverage in dispute, RFE/RL Report, (1999); Princen T., Finger M., Environmental NGOs in World Politics: Linking the Local and the Global, (1994); Protocol of the meeting of representatives of fuel-energy and water management complexes of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan on problem of the Toktogul Cascade water-energy resources use in 1996, ICWC Bulletin, pp. 39-41, (1995); Raiffa H., The Art and Science of Negotiation, (1982); Reznichenko G., The Aral Sea Tragedy, (1992); Sebenius J., Negotiation arithmetic: Adding and subtracting issues and parties, International Organization, 37, 2, pp. 281-316, (1983); Susskind L.E., Environmental Diplomacy: Negotiating More Effective Global Agreements, (1994); Synovitz R., Uzbekistan: Little progress seen in agricultural reforms, RFE/RL Report, (1997); Executive Summary, (1996); Legal and Institutional Aspects, 6, (1996); Thoenes S., Central Asians reach common ground over water, Financial Times, (1996); Human Development Under Transition-Uzbekistan, (1996); Cable From: U.S. Embassy in Almaty, Kazakhstan, (1996); Cable from U.S. Embassy in Almaty, Kazakhstan, (1997); Cable from U.S. Embassy in Almaty, Kazakhstan, (1997); Internal Memorandum.

To improve the resilience of farming communities in the region, crop diversification is proposed to enable farmers to grow high-value competitive crops and obtain more stable farm incomes. This study provides long-term, multidisciplinary analyses and strategies for strengthening crop diversification amongst farmers in the Aral Sea region. The study analyzed data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the statistical yearbook of 2000–2020. According to the gross margin study findings, farmers who use diversified cropping systems made considerably higher revenues than farmers relying on mono-cropping practices. This study demonstrates that greater crop diversity contributes to the rational use of natural resources and optimization plans, environmental sustainability, and food security as important natural and socio-economic issues in this region. The study findings suggest that proper crop diversification strategies need to be developed in the Aral Sea region to improve the sustainability of farming systems with enhanced resilience to devastating environmental and climate challenges. © 2023 by the authors.","agriculture; Aral Sea region; crop diversification; farmers’ income; gross margin; Simpson Index; stress environment","Aral Sea; Uzbekistan; agricultural diversification; alternative agriculture; cropping practice; farm; food security; income; long-term change; optimization; sustainability","","","","","Abu-Dabi Development bank","This study was funded by the Abu-Dabi Development bank within the project entitled: Development of Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems in Degraded areas of Karakalpakstan.","Khaitov B., Karimov A.A., Toderich K., Sultanova Z., Mamadrahimov A., Allanov K., Islamov S., Adaptation, grain yield and nutritional characteristics of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) genotypes in marginal environments of the Aral Sea basin, J.

This study aims to clarify the drivers of water stress across the 440 km Naryn River basin, headwater stem to the Syr Darya and the disappearing North Aral Sea. We use a combination of human and physical geography approaches to understand the meltwater-controlled hydrology of the system (using hydrochemical mixing models) as well as the human-water experience (via community surveys). Surveys indicate that current water stress is primarily a function of water management and access issues resulting from the clunky transition from Soviet era large-scale agriculture to post-Soviet small-plot farming. Snow and ice meltwaters play a dominant role in the surface and ground water supplies to downstream communities across the study's 4220 m elevation gradient, so future increases to water stress due to changes in volume and timing of water supply is likely given frozen waters' high sensitivities to warming temperatures. The combined influence of social, political and climate-induced pressures on water supplies in the Naryn basin suggest the need for proactive planning and adaptation strategies, and warrant concern for similar melt-sourced Central Asian watersheds. © 2017 by the authors.","Aral sea basin; Central asia; Cryosphere; Downstream water vulnerability; Glacial runoff; Groundwater; Meltwater; Mountain hydrology","Aral Sea; Kyrgyzstan; Naryn Basin; Sirdaryo; Uzbekistan; Groundwater; Hydrology; Surveys; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Aral Sea; Central Asia; Cryosphere; Glacial runoff; Meltwater; Mountain hydrology; Water vulnerabilities; cryosphere; glacial hydrology; groundwater flow; headwater; hydrochemistry; meltwater; runoff; vulnerability; water management; water stress; water supply; Water resources","","","","","","","Barnett T.P., Adam J.C., Lettenmaier D.P., Potential impacts of a warming climate on water availability in snow-dominated regions, Nature, 438, pp. 303-309, (2005); Hennessy K.B., Fitzharris B., Bates B.C., Harvey N., Howden M., Hughes L., Salinger J., Warrick R., Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change, (2007); Parry M., Canziani O., Palutikof J., van der Linden P., Hanson C., (2007); Immerzeel W.W., van Beek L.P.H., Bierkens M.F.P., Climate Change Will Affect the Asian Water Towers, Science, 328, (2010); Wilson A.M., Gladfelter S., Williams M.W., Shahi S., Baral P., Armstrong R., Racoviteanu A., High Asia: The International Dynamics of Climate Change and Water Security, J.

This study explores the optimized water allocation schemes in the study area at the provincial level under different incoming flow levels, based on the current water distribution quotas among riparian nations, which are usually ignored in related research. The optimization model of the inexact two‐stage stochastic programming method is used, which is characterized by probability distributions and interval values. Results show that (1) water allocation is redistributed among five different sectors. Livestock, industrial, and municipality have the highest water allocation priority, and water competition mainly exists in the other two sectors of irrigation and ecology; (2) water allocation is redistributed among six different provinces, and allocated water only in Bukhara and Khorezm can satisfy the upper bound of water demand; (3) the ecological sector can receive a guaranteed water allocation of 8.237–12.354 km3; (4) under high incoming flow level, compared with the actual water distribution, the total allocated water of four sectors (except for ecology) is reduced by 3.706 km3 and total economic benefits are increased by USD 3.885B. © 2021 by the authors.

This study deals with the question of how farmers in Khorezm perceive water and its management and how this facilitates or prevents water conservation, or ""water saving,"" in irrigated agriculture. To answer this from the perspective of the water users, we apply Schütz's lifeworld concept to the study of natural-resource management, thereby reconstructing the water lifeworld of Khorezmian farmers. We present the spatial and temporal boundaries of the water lifeworld; the different types of water, people, and land that farmers distinguish; and the institutions water management is based on. The analysis shows that religious values and the risk of being fined for water wasting facilitate water saving. However, the following barriers to water saving dominate farmer practices: (1) storage of saved water is not possible, (2) using much water creates social capital, (3) perceived water needs exceed the geographical realities, (4) the term ""water saving"" is not in use, and (5) farmers believe that water management is the state's responsibility. We conclude that water saving should be facilitated by environmental education, a strengthening of the water-inspection department Uzsuvnazorat, and the creation of decentralized storage options. © 2011, by the Rural Sociological Society.","","Khorazm; Uzbekistan; agricultural worker; conservation; irrigation; social capital; water management; water storage; water use","","","","","","","Abdullaev I., Mollinga P., The Socio-technical Aspects of Water Management: Emerging Trends at Grass Roots Level in Uzbekistan, Water, 2, 1, pp. 85-100, (2010); Abdullaev I., Nurmetova F., Abdullaeva F., Lamers J., Socio-technical Aspects of Water Management in Uzbekistan: Emerging Water Governance Issues at the Grass Root Level, Central Asian Waters: Social, Economic, Environmental and Governance Puzzle, pp. 89-103, (2008); Adoment M., Umweltkommunikation in der Landwirtschaft-Eine empirische Untersuchung der bäuerlichen Lebenswelt als kommunikative Lernsituation im Kontext nachhaltiger Entwicklung, (2004); Berger P., Luckmann T., Die Gesellschaftliche Konstruktion der Wirklichkeit-Eine Theorie der Wissenssoziologie, (1984); Butz D., Sustaining Indigenous Communities: Symbolic and Instrumental Dimensions of Pastoral Resource Use in Shmishal, Northern Pakistan, Canadian Geographer, 40, 1, pp. 36-53, (1996); Cleaver F., Reinventing Institutions: Bricolage and the Social Embeddedness of Natural Resource Management, European Journal of Development Research, 14, 2, pp. 11-30, (2002); Conrad C., (2006); Conti P.J., (2004); Dinar A., Subramanian A., Policy Implications from Water Pricing Experiences in Various Countries, Water Policy, 1, 2, pp. 239-250, (1998); Eberle T.S., Sinnkonstitution in Alltag und Wissenschaft, (1994); Esser H., The Rationality of Everyday Behaviour-A Rational Choice Reconstruction of the Theory of Action by Alfred Schütz, Rationality and Society, 5, 1, pp. 7-31, (1993); Flick U., von Kardorff E., Steinke I., A Companion to Qualitative Research, (2004); Forkutsa I., Sommer R., Shirokova Y.I., Lamers J.P.A., Kienzler K., Tischbein B., Martius C., Vlek P.L.G., Modelling Irrigated Cotton with Shallow Groundwater in the Aral Sea Basin of Uzbekistan: II.

This paper analyzes the temporal dynamics of GW table and salinity in Khorezm, a region of Uzbekistan which is situated on the lower Amu Darya River in the Aral Sea Basin and suffering from severe soil salinization. We furthermore identify the critical areas for potential soil salinization by examining GW table and salinity measured during 1990-2000 in 1,972 wells, covering the entire region. Additionally, case studies were performed to assess the contribution of the GW to the soil salinization on a field scale. Over the entire area, GW was only moderately saline averaging 1.75 ± 0.99 g l-1 However, GW levels were generally very shallow averaging 148±57 cm below the ground surface and thus likely to prompt secondary soil salinization. Three case studies where GW table, soil and GW salinity were closely monitored at the field scale, suggested that the elevated GW levels forced soil salinization by annually adding 3.5-14 t ha-1 of salts depending on the position and salinity of the GW table. Maps interpolated from the regional dataset revealed that GW was significantly shallower and more saline in the western and southern parts of Khorezm despite the presence of a drainage network which is rather uniformly distributed throughout the region. The results of the current study will assist the development of an improved drainage management in Khorezm. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Agriculture; Amu Darya River; Drainage; Secondary soil salinization; Spatial analysis","Asia; Eurasia; Khorazm; Uzbekistan; West Asia; Groundwater; Interpolation; Irrigation; Maps; Salinity measurement; Soils; Water management; Groundwater; Interpolation; Irrigation; Maps; Salinity measurement; Soils; groundwater; map; salinity; salinization; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; water management; water table; Groundwater management; Groundwater table; Soil salinization; Water management","","","","","Former Soviet Union; German Ministry for Education and Research; INTAS; International Association for the Promotion of Co-operation; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (0339970A)","Acknowledgements This research was carried out within the framework of the ZEF/UNESCO landscape restructuring project (www.uni-bonn.de/khorezm).

Command-and-control-based water management in the Aral Sea basin inherited from Soviet times did not create any incentives for investing in improved irrigation infrastructure, adopt water-wise approaches, and thus maintain flows into the Aral Sea. This study examined the potential for market-based water allocation to increase inflows to the Aral Sea while maintaining stable agricultural incomes. We find that a water trading system can improve inflows to the Aral Sea but would require significant compensation for agricultural producers. Agricultural producers can use the compensation payments to cope with reduced water supply by improving irrigation and conveyance efficiencies and by developing alternative rural activities such as livestock grazing, agro-processing, and cultivation of low water-consumptive crops. We also find that a water trading system would be more efficient if it includes both trade among irrigation sites and between sites and instream uses. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the authors' analysis, the most pressing current environmental problems are the loss of biodiversity and the complexity of the network of protected natural areas; insufficient levels of municipal solid waste processing; energy efficiency problems, in particular, the deterioration of the energy production and supply system; the imbalance between hydropower, irrigated agriculture and the environment; and problems of the Aral Sea. The article proposes solutions, including amendments to the legislation, the adoption of managerial decisions, and strengthening judicial control over compliance with the law. This article examines gaps in the legislative regulation of environmental safety and in policies at the national, regional and international levels. It also identifies future trends in the distribution of global resources that will be effective in protecting the environment, including the activities of the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC). It also analyses the basic environmental rights of citizens as well as cases and consequences of violation of such rights, focusing on the need to inform citizens about the state of the environment and existing environmental problems, which is now the aim of the regional environmental remediation programme, led by the EU.  © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

The Ili is the main water supplier to Lake Balkhash, the largest lake in Central Asia after desiccation of the Aral Sea. Agreements over water allocation have not been concluded between China and Kazakhstan. This paper investigated water consumption of agriculture and riparian ecosystems in the Ili river basin, to provide information for further debate on water allocation, through the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. The overall water consumption in the Ili river basin was 14.3 km3/a in 2000, 17.2 km3/a in 2005, and 15 km3/a in 2014. In 2000, China and Kazakhstan consumed 38% and 62% of the water, respectively. By 2014, the relative share of China's water consumption increased to 43%. In China, 80% of the water consumption is due to agriculture. High runoff during the past 10 years enabled increasing water consumption in China and sufficient water supply to agriculture and riparian ecosystems in Kazakhstan. When runoff of the Ili River decreases, as expected for most rivers in Central Asia, then irrigation efficiency has to be further increased in China, and irrigation systems in Kazakhstan have to be restored and modernized in order to reduce water consumption and protect Lake Balkhash and the riparian ecosystems. © 2017 by the authors.","Central asia; Evapotranspiration; Lake balkhash; MODIS; Remote sensing; Transboundary river; Upstream-downstream conflict; Wetland","Aral Sea; China; Ili River; Kazakhstan; Lake Balkhash; Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Ecology; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Image reconstruction; Irrigation; Lakes; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Runoff; Satellite imagery; Water management; Water resources; Water supply; Watersheds; Wetlands; Central Asia; Irrigation efficiency; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellites; MODIS; Riparian ecosystem; Simplified surface energy balance indices; Trans-boundary rivers; Upstream-downstream conflict; boundary dispute; desiccation; energy balance; evapotranspiration; international agreement; irrigation system; MODIS; remote sensing; riparian vegetation; river basin; satellite imagery; water supply; Rivers","","","","","","","(2005); Karthe D., Environmental Changes in Central and East Asian Drylands and their Effects on Large Central and East Asian Lakes and their Effects on Major River-Lake Systems, Quat.

The  irrigation water needed for these high production levels has been delivered by the massive diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, which naturally flowed into the Aral Sea. This diversion for agriculture was the main cause of the rapid decline of the Aral Sea, which is at only 10% of its original size today. The traditional method of irrigation, which relies on simple open canal systems, is highly inefficient for managing the region's critical and limited water resource. It  has been qualitatively estimated, for example, that irrigation water lost to evaporation and system inefficiencies is quite large. With the future availability of water at risk for agriculture in Central Asia, primarily due to the loss of glacial volume from global warming, along with declines in seasonal snowpack, it is clear that new approaches to water management are needed. Any serious efforts to  restore the Aral Sea and its ecological services would also reduce supplies of irrigation water for Uzbekistan. While regional conflict over water is unlikely, it must be considered since Uzbekistan is a downstream country among several that rely on the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for most of  their water supplies. To insure against these risks to cotton production and the underlying economy, better irrigation technologies are needed across Uzbekistan. However, these technologies can be quite expensive, especially given that water is still nearly free. In this case study we explore the use of real options analysis (ROA) to look for optimal investment strategies in efficient irrigation technologies in light of variable climate and policy uncertainties. © 2020 Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.","Climate change; Drip irrigation; Glaciers; Real options analysis; Water resources","","","","","","","","Anda J., Golub A., Strukova E., Economics of Climate Change Under Uncertainty: Benefits of Flexibility, Energy Policy, 37, 4, pp. 1345-1355, (2009); Cooke R., Golub A., Market-Based Methods for Monetizing Uncertainty Reduction: A Case Study, Resources for the Future, (2019); Djumaboev K., Manthrithilake H., Ayars J., Yuldashev T., Akramov B., Karshiev R., Eshmuratov D., Growing Cotton in Karshi Steppe, Uzbekistan: Water Productivity Differences with Three Different Methods of Irrigation, (2019); Golub A., Brody M., Uncertainty, Climate Change, and Irreversible Environmental Effects: Application of Real Options to Environmental Benefit-Cost Analysis, Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences, 7, 4, pp. 519-526, (2017); Golub A., Lugovoy O., Potashnikov V., Quantifying Barriers to Decarbonization of the Russian Economy: Real Options Analysis of Investment Risks in Low-Carbon Technologies, Climate Policy, 19, 6, pp. 716-724, (2019); Larson D.F., Khidirov D., Schuman I., Uzbekistan-Strengthening the Horticulture Value Chain (English).

Natural forests have been severely degraded. Due to the nature of the topography and the arid climate, vast areas are subject to soil erosion. Loss of vegetation and soil humus have created ever more arid conditions. Abandoning the lands, poor reclamation schemes, overgrazing and destruction of vegetation for fuelwood have all caused desertifkation. The biological productivity of pastures has also deteriorated. This reduced productivity has affected livestock and has caused dramatic changes to the patterns of wildlife populations. Soil salinization and waterlogged lands are common. Farmland and pastures have been contaminated by landmines. Heavy concentrations of air-borne particulates and considerable amounts of transboundary pollutants from the Aral Sea have been found. Use of chemicals and the machinery of war have damaged the ecosystems. Collection of plants and animals is unregulated and has resulted in excessive removal or extermination of some species endemic to the Hindu Kush. Uprooting of some plants and dynamite fishing are increasing and a disturbing number of fauna and flora are endangered. Agriculture is traditional, and natural resources are not being used in a sustainable way. A sound environmental strategy needs to be formulated and adopted. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Afghanistan; Degradation; Environment; Environmental policy","Afghanistan; environmental degradation; environmental policy; nature-society relations; refugee","","","","","","","Quoted in M.H.

According to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development findings (OECD), due to the excessive usage and climate changes, lots of freshwater resources will be disappeared by 2030; therefore over 3.9 billion people all over the world will face a fresh water shortage. Lack of water resources will cause political, social and economic crisis and will also result in extensive migrations and finally triggers regional conflicts. One outcome of the colonization of tsarism and then the Soviet era was destroying natural infrastructures including water resources (e.g. drying the Aral Sea), creating marginal areas, and making Central Asian countries a single product economy. The single product agricultural industry in the Central Asian socialist economy completely depends on the irrigation system. To irrigate cotton planting farms in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, more than 90 percent of existing water supplies being used. This amount becomes more catastrophic where in some areas, about 10.000 cubic meters of water were used for every hectare of the cotton farm. After the independence, this competition continued between 5 Central Asian countries. Increasing cotton production in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan made these two countries pioneers in the world. Between 2004-2005, these two countries accounted for 65 percent of the world’s cotton production. This policy in the agriculture industry results in severe depletion of farms, excessive use of chemical fertilizer as well as a reduction in cotton production in the last ten years, so this reduction in addition to population growth, makes these 5 Central Asian countries import food products. Decreasing freshwater quality, increasing the amount of salt in the soil, and farms salinity along with fast population growth were some causes of appearing marginal areas in Central Asian countries. Marginal areas because of the lack of social, educational, healthy, and cultural services and facilities are a place for future crises. Based on the World Council’s estimates about International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) studies, Central Asia is among areas that are severely affected by water shortages; the drying of the Aral Sea was a disaster and some parts of Central Asia were depopulated. Based on World Bank predictions, water shortages in this area will reach 25 to 30 percent by 2050 and it is also predicted that the population of Central Asia will increase to 90 million. It shows that we should expect a different crisis in Central Asia in which the results will be expanded all over the area including the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia. On the other hand, the area is located at the crossroads of international interests in the new geopolitical and geo-economic conditions which were created in the last decade of the twentieth century. From then on, it has highlighted the importance of this region in political stability and global security. In new conditions, Germany was always trying to find a suitable place to increase its economic and political presence in the region. At the beginning of 1990’s, political leaders of Germany showed some signs of independence of action in foreign policy by adopting a multilateral policy in the international system and gradually approaching other centers of powers; to this end, areas such as Central Asia became a place to show the power and the economic, commercial and almost political presence of Germany. On the other hand, political and security conditions in Afghanistan and their effect on multiple crises in Central Asia as well as conflicts among Ukraine and Russia and its effect on the gas transmission to Europe increased the importance of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Germany as the biggest industrial unit in the European Union is the most important exporter of technology and industrial goods. Because of the dilapidated economic and production structure left from the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have the potential needs to accept technology and Germany’s investment in different sectors. Therefore, during years after independence, Germany tried to take advantage of these needs and increase its share. But Central Asian countries tend to face the crisis due to different factors including extremism, terrorism, drug trafficking, poverty, unemployment, extensive addiction, tribalism, the unfinished process of state-nation building in these countries, fragile security and educational structures (intelligence Police), low legitimate governments based in Central Asia, the intervention of regional and trans-regional countries including Russia, China and United States and the most important factor water storages. A crisis that if remains pervasive, will not only have social, political, economic and environmental consequences in Central Asia but also leads to the growth of extremism, terrorism, increased drug trafficking, disruption in energy flow and migration to Europe. Also, it poses a serious threat to Germany’s interests, especially its economic interests in the region. Therefore, Central Asia and countries within its sphere became of strategic importance to Germany in various ways, including in diversifying energy demands, economic, trade, security and cultural resources after the end of the cold war. So, all these factors have caused concern in German Foreign policy and this country has tried different measures to manage water resources. According to the aforementioned items, by using a descriptive-analytical method based on the theoretical framework of neoliberalism institutionalism, this paper seeks to investigate German measures to manage water resources in Central Asia and prevent political and social crisis caused by lack of sustainable management in the field of vital water resources in Central Asia. The results of this paper show that despite obstacles such as lack of mutual trust between the governments, the dominance of some Central Asian countries, low level of cooperation between 5 countries of the region concerning water resources management, and a series of structural problems, Germany has been able to work through multilateral cooperation between institutions and scientific centers and carry out important and significant measures, both technical and academic.

In case studies of other environmental disasters, research has shown that environmental exposures may impact not only the physiological but also the psychosocial health of individuals. This research aims to determine the contribution of the environmental disaster to the psychosocial health of people living in Karakalpakstan, a semi-autonomous Republic in Uzbekistan. An interview survey was carried out by Médecins Sans Frontières, with the assistance of the McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, local Universities and local health care workers, on a random sample of 1118 individuals aged 18 years and older in three communities in Karakalpakstan in May/June 1999. The communities were chosen according to distance from the former seashore, urban/rural characteristics and ethnic composition. The survey included questions about perceived general health, the General Health Questionnaire, the somatic symptom checklist of the Symptom Check List-90, questions about perceptions of the environmental disaster, social support as well as socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Findings show that 41% of all respondents reported environmental concern while 48% reported levels of somatic symptoms (SCL-90) associated with emotional distress, above the normalized cut-point.

In particular, crop type information is essential to understand the spatial distribution of water usage and anticipate the risk of water scarcity and the consequent danger of food insecurity. This applies to arid regions such as the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), Central Asia, where agriculture relies heavily on irrigation. Here, remote sensing is valuable to map crop types, but its quality depends on consistent ground-truth data. Yet, in the ASB, such data are missing. Addressing this issue, we collected thousands of polygons on crop types, 97.7% of which in Uzbekistan and the remaining in Tajikistan. We collected 8,196 samples between 2015 and 2018, 213 in 2011 and 26 in 2008. Our data compile samples for 40 crop types and is dominated by “cotton” (40%) and “wheat”, (25%). These data were meticulously validated using expert knowledge and remote sensing data and relied on transferable, open-source workflows that will assure the consistency of future sampling campaigns. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Dirmeyer P.A., Niyogi D., de Noblet-Ducoudre N., Dickinson R.E., Snyder P.K., Impacts of land use change on climate, Int.

They face deep-seated social and economic problems in addition to the environmental threat of the shrinking of the Aral Sea due to overexploitation of water resources for agriculture during Soviet rule. But the Caspian basin holds one of the largest unexploited sources of oil and is attracting significant international interest. Construction of a pipeline across Afghanistan to the open sea in Pakistan requires the resolution of the Afghan conflict. Developments in the region have implications for China, and the Middle East as well as the West and the republics' former rulers. Prospects for stability are linked to the republics' economic weaknesses. Conditions are likely to worsen as transition continues and social tensions could be heightened, while the Islamic revival is exerting greater influence.","","Asia, (Central); developing region; economic crisis; geopolitical study; independence; political change; post-independence; regional impact; resource exploitation; transitional economy","","","","","","","Mesbahi M., Central Asia and the Caucasus after the Soviet Union.
