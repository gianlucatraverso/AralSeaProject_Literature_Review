Each of the three places discussed here - the Salton Sea, Owens Lake, and Mono Lake - has its own unique historical and geographic circumstances, but the story of each place has certain parallels to the Aral Sea disaster. Each place experienced dramatic water losses during much of the 20th century, but the emergence of environmental science and law in recent decades has caused significant policy changes. The Salton Sea is still declining, and modest efforts by state and federal agencies to halt the decline are inadequate. A proposal to build dikes to save part of the water body and convert the rest to salt evaporation ponds cited the Aral Sea as a model for the Salton Sea's future. The dry Owens Lake bed yields windblown dust that exceeds the Clean Air standard for fine particulate matter (PM 10), so Los Angeles is now required to release additional water back into the basin to create more shallow wetlands. In Mono Lake, a negotiated settlement has reversed the water loss while protecting vital interests of all parties, and a substantial ecological restoration plan is being implemented. The history of the American analogs to the Aral Sea, especially the success story of Mono Lake, may indicate potential pathways to progress in reducing problems caused by large-scale water diversion.

It is meant to purposely highlight the reality of the situation in Central Asia: the Aral Sea that was once a thriving body of water is no more. That sea is dead. What does exist in its place are the Aral seas: there are in essence three bodies of water, one of which is being purposefully restored and its level is rising (the Little Aral), and two others which are still marginally connected, although they continue to decline in level (the Big Aral West and the Big Aral East). In 1960 the level of the sea was about 53 m above sea level. By 2006 the level had dropped by 23 m to 30 m above sea level. This was not a scenario generated by a computer model. It was a process of environmental degradation played out in real life in a matter of a few decades, primarily as a result of human activities. Despite wishes and words to the contrary, it will take a heroic global effort to save what remains of the Big Aral. It would also take a significant degree of sacrifice by people and governments in the region to restore the Big Aral to an acceptable level, given that the annual rate of flow reaching the Amudarya River delta is less than a 10th of what it was several decades ago. Conferring World Heritage status to the Aral Sea(s) could spark restoration efforts for the Big Aral. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.","","Asia, Central; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Uzbekistan; Water Supply; Amu Darya Delta; Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; West Asia; sea water; anthropogenic effect; environmental degradation; habitat restoration; human activity; marine ecosystem; water level; World Heritage Site; Asia; environmental protection; human; legal aspect; methodology; review; sea; standard; Uzbekistan; water supply","","","","","","","Tsinzerling V.V., Irrigation in the Amudarya Basin, (1927); Creeping Environmental Problems and Sustainable Development in the Aral Sea Basin, (1999); Wegerich K., Natural drought or human-made water scarcity in Uzbekistan?, Central Asia and the Caucasus, 2, pp. 154-162, (2002); Kamalov Y., Why do we have to save the sea?, International Conference on the Aral Sea, (2006); Lindgren E., The human health situation in the Aral region: Causes and concerns, International Conference on the Aral Sea, (2006); Middleton N., Hope for the little Aral Sea, Geography Review, 18, pp. 21-23, (2005); Glantz M.H., Figueroa R.M., Does the Aral Sea merit heritage status?, Global Environmental Change, 7, pp. 357-380, (1997); Scientific, and Cultural Organization), Website created by UNESCO, which functions as a laboratory of ideas and a standard-setter to forge, (2007); First submitted, (2007)","M.H.

This paper presents the development of a new integrated hydrologic- agronomic-economic model in the context of a river basin in which irrigation is the dominant water use and irrigation-induced salinity presents a major environmental problem. The model's main advantage is its ability to reflect the interrelationships between essential hydrologic, agronomic, and economic components and to explore both economic and environmental consequences of various policy choices. All model components are incorporated into a single consistent model, which is solved in its entirely by a simple but effective decomposition approach. The model is applied to a case study of water management in the Syr Darya River basin in Central Asia.","Economic analysis; Irrigation; Optimization; River basins; Water resources management","Aral Sea; irrigation; optimization; river basin; water management; Economics; Hydrology; Saline water; Water resources; basin management; integrated approach; irrigation; optimization; river basin; water economics; water management; River basin management; River basin projects","","","","","","","Abdel-buyem M.S., Skaggs R.W., Extension of DRAINMOD for simulation water management in arid regions, Transc.

Transboundary waters in Central Asia play important role in the economic cooperation among riparian states, including those who are members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). At the current stage of transboundary waters management in Central Asia, the obsolete legal status is evident. The international water law sources developed under the United Nations’ auspices have no binding application due to luck of formal membership of the EAEU states in these treaties. Also the regional set of regulations, especially for the Aral Sea Basin, needs further enhancement and more efficient implementation. The bilateral interstate regulatory framework of the managemennt of waters shared by EAEU states in Central Asia requires development of additional rules to enable better accommodation of challenges existing in terms of the current interstate cooperation. Having said that can one further assume that EAEU could serve as a new legal framework for more effective cooperation on transboundary watercourses in Central Asia? The answer might be yes, but… the current stage of the legal framework for cooperation on transboundary waters within the EAEU requires sufficient enhancements in terms of developing its legal and institutional framework. The first condition for EAEU to serve as framework for cooperation on transboundary waters of Central Asia is to strengthen the regulatory framework for the cooperation of EAEU member states regarding environmental issues in general and transboundary water relations in particular, able to accommodate two main goals: environmental protection on the one hand and economic development on the other hand. The EAEU legal framework shall also lead to improvement of existing institutional cooperation and a dispute settlement mechanism on transboundary waters shared by the member states of the EAEU. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Central Asia’s water management; Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU); International water law; Transboundary water management","Aral Sea; Central Asia; Economics; Environmental protection; Water management; Central Asia; Dispute settlement mechanisms; Efficient implementation; Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU); Institutional framework; International waters; Transboundary water; Transboundary watercourse; economic development; economic integration; environmental issue; environmental protection; implementation process; institutional framework; international law; legislation; regulatory framework; United Nations; water management; Laws and legislation","","","","","","","Amanzholov Z.M., Multilateral treaties Ensuring Water Security in Central Asia, Mosc J Int Law, 4, pp. 226-244, (2007); Blagov S., Kyrgyz hydro projects hit rocks as Russia rethinks economic plans for Central Asia.

The region's water-related problems include water allocation controversies, competition between irrigation and hydropower, water quality deterioration, environmental degradation, loss of species and biodiversity and climate change. The Aral Sea and its two main tributaries, the Amudarya and the Syrdarya, are the core of the Central Asian water network. The Amudarya is the biggest Central Asian river in terms of annual water runoff. The UNECE Water Convention establishes sound rules for the parties' cooperation on environmental and water resources, including obligations to prevent, control and reduce transboundary impacts. Fourthly, a rigid concern with compliance alone appears to leave no room for appreciation of the communicative and constitutive role of international law. International law must be considered in a more analytical manner, as a vehicle that defines means and mechanisms and enables and empowers actors to interact over shared waters.","","Amu Darya River; Aral Sea; Central Asia; Kazakhstan; Syr Darya River; biodiversity; climate change; compliance; environmental degradation; environmental impact; hydroelectric power; international law; irrigation system; runoff; transboundary cooperation; water management; water quality; water resource","","","","","","","The Millennium Development Goals Report 2008, (2008); Climate Change and Water.

It comprises a large-scale irrigation system which conveys water from the river Amudarya to agricultural land cropped mainly with cotton, wheat, and rice. Khorezm's water resources are vulnerable because they depend on upstream developments and are indispensable for rural livelihoods and state budgets. Since water scarcity is expected to increase in the future, sustainable water management is a necessity. Hence the objectives of the paper are to (1) conceptualise the distinctive features of water management in Khorezm, (2) provide an integrated analysis of water management by establishing linkages between society, technical infrastructure, and the bio-physical environment, and (3) make policy and technology recommendations for improved water management. To conceptualise water management in Khorezm, the paper distinguishes three types of practices: formal practices, strategic practices, and discursive practices. Based on these, it presents an analysis of water management on the state water management level, the water user association level, and the farmer and field level. For each level, recommendations are given. The paper concludes that elements of IWRM such as transparency, accountability, participation, and technical efficiency are relevant to improve water management in Khorezm as elsewhere. In addition, it suggests for Khorezm, in particular, to create legal space for agency and innovation. Technical tools such as models acquire additional importance in this context for facilitating transparency and enabling agents across the management hierarchy to access and make use of information. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

The shrinkage of the Aral Sea and a dysfunctional agricultural economy in Central Asia from excess upstream diversions are examples of the 'tragedy of the commons' that no nation should want to emulate. State regulation of water is imperative because ground and surface water resources are naturally open access commons. Only an effective entitlement regime, or direct state control of all water use, can prevent the over-use of water resources. Without a regime which requires some form of state license before a use can be initiated and the effective enforcement of entitlements, unsustainable, wasteful over-use will occur.","","legislation; regulatory approach; sustainability; water management","","","","","","","","A.D.

These challenges to an important extent originated from the decision of the Soviet Union to develop water-intensive crops (mainly cotton and wheat) in the region. The complex irrigation systems and massive hydropower infrastructure established under Soviet times enabled extensive agricultural production in the arid and semi-arid zones in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The water intensity of the agricultural sector imposed a huge burden on the sustainability of water supply in the region, as highlighted by the destruction of the Aral Sea. Global warming exacerbates the water problem in Central Asia. Melting glaciers will intensify water scarcity in the region and at the same time climate change will increase the water needs of the agricultural sector. In this increasingly challenging context for the management of water supply, the question of access to water could lead to an ‘escalation of tensions and of conflict potential in the region’. Besides its geopolitical importance, the case of Central Asia is particularly relevant for a study on the international regulation of water services because it presents a clear example of the complex interaction between water and energy supply. In Central Asia, the lower riparian countries (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) are endowed with large reserves of fossil energy but are dependent on the upper riparian countries (Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) for access to water. The upper riparian countries hold large water resources and have a huge potential for hydropower generation but have only limited fossil energy reserves. Without access to fossil energy, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan make use of hydropower for electricity production in the winter, which reduces the availability of water during the summer when water is needed for irrigation. Interstate cooperation based on the reciprocal exchange of water and energy resources is considered by many as a solution to Central Asia’s water management challenges. However, in the past interstate water-energy cooperation has been affected by repeated failures of the States to comply with their water-energy supply obligations. In addition to the ‘upstream’ integration of water and energy, there is an important ‘downstream’ (or end-user) perspective to the water-energy nexus in Central Asia. In the arid and semi-arid Central Asian climate, the irrigation-based agricultural sector uses more than 90 per cent of Central Asia’s water resources. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","","","","","","","","","International Crisis Group, Water Pressures in Central Asia, Europe and Central Asia Report No 233, (2014); Frenken K., Irrigation in Central Asia in Figures, (2013); Micklin P., Et al., The Aral Sea: The Devastation and Partial Rehabilitation of a Great Lake, (2014); Cisneros B.E.J., Et al., Freshwater Resources, Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects.

These transboundary basins are under increased pressure from growing population and economies, unsustainable development and the impact of climate change, making it essential to cooperate and enhance legal regulation. The paper seeks to contribute to a better understating of the nature of legal principles applied to transboundary waters in CA by analyzing whether and how transboundary harm is addressed in relevant treaties in the selected river basins. The paper finds that in most regional treaties the no-harm principle is phrased as a due diligence obligation, without defining a transboundary harm and specifying its threshold and potential activities that might cause it. In addition to improving the quality of regional agreements and enhancing procedural cooperation, the participation of countries in MEAs can offer a supportive legal framework to specify no-harm related obligations. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Central Asia; International water law; No-harm principle; Transboundary impact","Afghanistan; Aral Sea; Central Asia; China; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Russian Federation; Tajikistan; Talas; Talas Basin; Uzbekistan; climate change; climate effect; legal rights; legislation; regulatory approach; river basin; sustainable development","","","","","","","Asinskij V.A., Mironenkov A.P., Sarsembekov T.T., Institutional and legal support to manage the basins of Central Asia’s transboundary rivers as a factor of development of hydropower in the region, Evrazijskaâ èkonomičeskaâ integraciâ, 4, 13, pp. 82-88, (2011); Case concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina V Uruguay) ICJ General List No 135, (2010); Dukhovny V., de Schutter J., Water in Central Asia: Past, present, future, (2011); Draft Articles on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses; Stepping Towards Stronger Transboundary Cooperation in Chu-Talas Basin, (2019); Janusz-Pawletta B., Current legal challenges to institutional governance of transboundary water resources in Central Asia and Joint Management Arrangements, Environmental Earth Sciences, 73, 2, pp. 887-896, (2014); McCaffrey S.C., The contribution of the UN Convention on the law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses, International Journal of Global Environmental Issues, 1, pp. 253-254, (2001); McCaffrey S.C., The 1997 UN convention: Compatibility and complementarity, The UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes: Its Contribution to International Water Cooperation, pp. 51-59, (2015); Ozturk T., Turp M.T., Turkes M., Et al., Projected changes in temperature and precipitation climatology of CA CORDEX Region 8 by using RegCM4.3.5, Atmospheric Research, 183, pp. 296-307, (2017); Trail Smelter Case (United States V Canada) III Reports of International Arbitral Awards 1905, (1941); Enabling Transboundary Cooperation and Integrated Water Resources Management in the Chu and Talas River Basins, (2018); Second Assessment of Transboundary Rivers, Lakes and Groundwaters.

They are important natural assets with considerable aesthetic, cultural, economic, recreational, scientific, conservation and ecological values. Some features, notably the composition of the biota, uniquely distinguish them from other aquatic ecosystems. The paper reviews the nature of environmental impacts and their effects upon salt lakes. Its aims are two-fold: to draw attention to the extensive damage that salt lakes have now undergone, and to indicate the likely status of salt lakes in 2025. Salt lakes develop as the termini of inland drainage basins where hydrological inputs and outputs are balanced. These conditions occur in arid and semi-arid regions (approximately one-third of total world land area). Many human activities threaten or have already impacted salt lakes, especially surface inflow diversions, salinization and other catchment activities, mining, pollution, biological disturbances (e.g. introduction of exotic species), and anthropogenically-induced climatic and atmospheric changes. The effects of such activities are always adverse and include changes to the natural character of salt lakes, loss of biodiversity and fundamental limnological changes. The effects are geographically widespread, mostly irreversible, and degrade the values of salt lakes. Four salt lakes are discussed, namely the Aral Sea in central Asia, Mono Lake in California, USA, and Lake Eyre and Lake Cantara South, in Australia. By 2025, most natural salt lakes will have undergone some adverse change. Many permanent ones will have decreased in size and increased in salinity, and many unnatural saline water-bodies will have appeared. In certain regions, many seasonally-filled salt lakes are likely to be drier for longer periods. The extent to which episodically-filled salt lakes will change by 2025 will largely depend upon the nature of climate change in arid regions. Objective cost/benefit analyses of adversely affecting salt lakes are rare, and international bodies have not properly recognized salt lakes as important inland aquatic ecosystems. To redress this situation, there is a need to raise awareness of: (1) the values of salt lakes, (2) the nature of threats and impacts from human activities, and (3) their special management requirements. More effective management and conservation measures need to be implemented. Mono Lake provides an example of what can be achieved in the conservation of salt lakes. Its conservation was largely brought about by (1) the commitment of a non-governmental organization which recognized its non-economic values, (2) the freedom to express views, (3) a legal system which took account of non-economic values, and (4) a legislature which implemented judicial findings. The conservation of Mono Lake was difficult; the conservation of other salt lakes is likely to be even more difficult. Only international pressure from appropriate organizations will be effective for the conservation of many.","Climate change; Conservation; Environmental threats; Saline lakes; Salinity; Salinization","cellular organisms; Arid regions; Climate change; Drainage; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Water pollution; lake water; aquatic ecosystem; ecosystem management; global perspective; habitat conservation; lake; salinity; article; biodiversity; climate change; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental protection; exotic species; hydrology; lake ecosystem; legal aspect; limnology; mining; salinity; salt lake; water pollution; Salt lakes; Lakes","","","","","","","Aladin N.V., Filippov A.A., Plotnikov I.S., Orlova M.I., Williams W.D., Changes in the structure and function of biological communities in the northern part of the Aral Sea (Small Aral Sea) 1984-1994, International Journal of Salt Lake Research, 7, pp. 301-343, (1998); Aladin N.V., Plotnikov I.S., Large saline lakes of former USSR: A summary review, Hydrobiologia, 267, pp. 1-12, (1993); Alcocer J., Escobar E., The drying up of the Mexican Plateau axalapazcos, Salinet, 4, pp. 44-46, (1990); Alcocer J., Williams W.D., Historical and recent changes in Lake Texcoco, a saline lake in Mexico, International Journal of Salt Lake Research, 5, pp. 45-61, (1996); Bayly I.A.E., The general biological classification of aquatic environments with special reference to those in Australia, Australian Inland Waters and their Fauna: Eleven Studies, pp. 78-104, (1967); Bohrer B., Heidenreich H., Schimmele M., Schultze M., Numerical prognosis for salinity profiles of future lakes in the opencast mine of Merseburg-Ost, International Journal of Salt Lake Research, 7, pp. 235-260, (1998); Bowler J.M., Australian salt lakes.

These results show that the fine mineral dust aerosol (0.1–1 (Formula presented.) m) considerably contributes to the total aerosol content of the atmospheric surface layer under such conditions. The scaling of daytime mean size (Formula presented.) distribution at a height of 2 m is approximated by dependence (Formula presented.), where (Formula presented.) changes from 4 to 6 for different years of measurements, in contrary to the law (Formula presented.) for fraction (Formula presented.) m. Different compositions of aerosol particles at (Formula presented.) m and (Formula presented.) m, including multicomponent fractions (less than (Formula presented.) m) may result in different probabilities of their integration and disintegration. It is hypothesized that the equilibrium distribution of submicron aerosol is a result of sequential disintegration of aerosol particles with a possibility for their reintegration.

Hydropower potential in the Basin is large but remains underutilised to date. The upstream riparian states-Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan-are the lead producers of hydropower in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya Basins, respectively. In order to avoid regional conflicts over the use of water for food or electricity generation, riparian countries should develop viable forms of cooperation. There are solid examples of such cooperation in the Basin already. Legal and regulatory solutions like the 1998 Syr Darya Agreement should be introduced for supporting food production in summer for the upstream countries (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan) and electricity generation in the downstream countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan). Large water storage and hydropower development projects in upstream river courses where the hydropower potential is also the largest continue to emerge in the region (e.g., the Rogun Dam Project, which is currently under construction). If managed in a collaborative manner, they will bring multiple benefits to collaborating countries, including improved reliability of supply and availability of water for agriculture, domestic use and electricity generation.

Results of research on vegetation distribution along salinity gradients, and evaluation of some indicators of salt tolerance are reported. The outcome of the screening of many plant species, herbs, shrubs and trees and the development of agro-silvi pastoral systems as a means of rehabilitating degraded land and improving livelihoods is outlined. The development and adoption of Biosaline Agriculture practices as a way to restore productivity of salt affected desert lands is explained. Key Points Rangeland vegetation of the arid and semi arid zones of Uzbekistan served as a crucial natural resource for livelihood development of the pastoral communities for many centuries and at the same time acts now as an ecological tool of protection against desertification. It is thus of great importance to preserve natural rangelands and to maintain their long term stability through application of consistent grazing management or using of improvement methods through cultivation of native drought and salt tolerant species. Facing the challenges of food security, Central Asian countries are keen to improve utilization of rangelands. Unfortunately, most governments in the region have limited financial resources, inconsistent legal instruments, and weak capacity to regulate and monitor sustainable use of rangelands. Thus, a more holistic approach to the ecosystem processes is needed in order to reduce the feed gap and mitigate rangeland degradation and desertification. Spatial and temporal changes of natural rangelands vegetation in the arid area affected by salinity need to be understood in order to initiate different revegetation strategies. Halophytes are an underutilized plant resource. They grow well in association with a variety of arid/semi-arid rangeland species and often provide severe competition to perennial species, both in natural and improved pastures. Where rangeland degradation has occurred there is need for rehabilitation measures to be applied. Incorporating fodder halophytes into the agro-silvi pastoral system or domestication of wild halophytes species represents low cost strategies for rehabilitation of desert degraded rangelands and abandoned farmer lands affected both by soil and water salinity. Introduction and adaptation of native drought tolerant fodder desert species and halophytes have the potential to provide a way to improve the livelihood of farmer's income at abandoned degraded marginal areas. A mixture of desert fodder species planted within the inter-spaces of salt-tolerant trees/shrubs plantations improves productivity of degraded rangelands affected by soil salinization. Application of such an approach solves the animal feed gaps in the lands degraded both by overgrazing and salinity, and leads to increased income for farmers. Agro-silvi-pastoral approaches for landscape planning and rehabilitation of saline soils represent a model of ecosystem function/services for agro-pastoral communities as adaptation measures to mitigate climate change impacts Dryland salinity and associated water quality are recognized to be among the most severe natural resource degradation problems in the marginal desert belt of Aral Sea Basin. Access to irrigation water in this region has drastically decreased in the last years, which caused additional obstacles to rangelands productivity and agricultural production. Replacement of deep-rooted, perennial native vegetation with shallow-rooted, annual agricultural crops and halophytic pastures has resulted in increased recharge causing shallow saline water tables leading to dryland salinity and loss of plant diversity. This results in greater amounts of water entering a groundwater system, water table rise and the concentration of naturally occurring salts near the soil surface. The Integrated Biosaline Agriculture Program for sustainable use of marginal mineralized water and salt affected soils for food-feed crops and forage legumes assists in improving food security, alleviating poverty and enhancing ecosystem health in smallholder crop-livestock systems. Diversification of agro-ecosystems and development of new agricultural capacities could increase income source of rural poor and farmers which so far are often dependent on two major crops (e.g. cotton and wheat). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The bounding of the Aral Sea problems at various scales of consideration from local to global is explored, with a particular emphasis on the importance of a bioregional approach. Not only is the Aral disaster a global problem, part of the overall climate crisis, but it is also a much replicated disaster, sharing a global but decentralized impact.

Many international and national bodies have stressed the need for community participation in the conservation and management of inland waters. Community participation is needed for three basic reasons: to implement management measures difficult to enforce without community support; to act as a mechanism in protecting inland waters through support of conservation bodies; and, through voluntary actions, to monitor, restore and rehabilitate inland water-bodies. 2. It is important to conserve and manage inland waters because of their many values and uses. To participate fully in conservation and management measures, the community needs to (a) recognize the importance of inland waters as a part of the global hydrological cycle, (b) have some knowledge of the nature and effects of major human impacts on inland waters, and (c) be aware of certain legal issues. 3. The 'community' is heterogeneous in nature but community groups of similar interest can be recognized. They vary from small, local action groups, through national groups to international bodies. They provide advice to and support government actions; others oppose and seek to change government actions. Community involvement can be at various levels, from the relatively inactive to the vigorously proactive. 4. Environmental education of the community should begin in childhood, continue at school and other educational institutions, and last throughout life. Information on the conservation and management of inland waters is available from many sources, but a powerful, modern source is the World Wide Web. 5. Four case studies are discussed with particular reference to community participation: Lake Washington and Mono Lake in the US (successful outcomes), the Aral Sea in central Asia and Lake Pedder in Australia (unsuccessful outcomes).

The remnants from the Soviet legal settings are still recognizable in the todays biding legal framework for transboundary cooperation and presented in the chapter. Since the riparian states underwent in-depth changes in social-economical terms, it is needed to introduce the modern legal principles and procedures to facilitate the management and protection of transboundary waters in Central Asia. The current legal framework binding for the Aral Sea riparian states is made of different levels of regulations. The regional (Aral Sea Basin) level of interstate cooperation is based on the both (1) international water law (incl. application of the global multilateral environmental agreements and relevant multilateral agreements adopted within the Commonwealth of Independent States) and (2) multilateral legal acts adopted by the riparian states restricted within the scope to the Aral Sea Basin. There are also a number of multilateral and bilateral transboundary agreements covering the interstate cooperation on the sub-basins of Syr Daria and Amu Daria.

In the Aral Sea basin, due to the intensive commissioning of new irrigated areas and various types of hydraulic structures (reservoir, village storage, canals, etc.), on a large scale, there is a violation of the natural laws of the regime and balance of groundwater. As a result of the hydrotechnical impact on water resources, the usual ""losses""affecting the water balance and runoff, in the initial stage of their formation, cause processes such as flooding and flooding of adjacent territories, excessive wetting of non-irrigated lands and worsen the operation of reclamation projects. The open collector-drainage network existing around the land reclamation projects and cities does not provide a normal outflow of groundwater; its maintenance into a working and sanitary state requires large capital expenditures. High groundwater level with high salinity leads to the destruction of the basement of buildings and structures, the complete flooding of groundwater communications, the death of green spaces. According to some available data, losses incurred from exposure to aggressive groundwater in a number of cities in Uzbekistan range from 2.5 to 10 million dollars. The objects of reclamation control are established depending on the main factor determining the reclamation state of irrigated lands, on the degree of their natural drained. Essential criteria for determining the relationship of groundwater with soil-soils and their influence on the reclamation state of irrigated lands are the depth of groundwater table and the degree of mineralization, as well as their seasonal and long-term regime. The presented dissertation is devoted to the study of this insufficiently solved problem. Scientific and technical solutions to this problem are considered on the example of the built-up areas of irrigated areas of the Republic of Uzbekistan, where there are problems of engineering protection from the negative effects of groundwater. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Saliev B., Soliev M.B., Solieva M.B., The solution to the problem of waterlogging forecasting from irrigated lands, ""economic Sand Finance"" Mag.

It is interesting to consider how Kazakhstan is developing renewable energy usage. Kazakhstan with its huge territory and not very large population is having great potential for renewable energy production. Most of the territory has sufficient amount for solar energy harvest and also large amount of area with high speed of wind, which has large potential to produce sufficient amount of wind energy. Areas such as Jungar Gates and Chylyk Corridor have a huge potential for the production of energy by wind turbines. The part of Kazakhstan between the Balkhash Lake and Aral Sea is not very populated due to shortage of water. At the same time this area has a very high level of solar irradiation. It is possible to harvest there a large amount of solar energy if it would have many solar panel arrays installed. The problem difficult to overcome would be the maintenance of these solar panel arrays due to low population and pure living conditions. There are at least two major reasons to go for renewable energy development in the country. First one - Kazakhstani leadership is looking into opportunities to change from a resource economy (it is one of the oil producing countries - it has more than 2% of the world oil reserve and many other resources) to a technology driven one. In this case resources will be used to produce different products. Due to that, one of the challenges is to move from fossil fuel driven energy production to alternative sources and the potential is there. Another stimulus is that Kazakhstan is the country which has joined to Kyoto protocol and Paris agreement. Thus, Kazakhstan tends to reduce greenhouse effect and also Kazakhstan is going towards the generation of energy from alternative sources. The government of the country is developing the legislation in direction to encourage producers and users to increase share of alternative sources for energy generation in Kazakhstan. It provides users with benefits if they supply energy produced by alternative sources to the grid with preferable rates. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Biomass; Geothermal; Hydro; Renewable energy; Solar; Wind","Biomass; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Petroleum deposits; Proven reserves; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Alternative source; Geothermal; Hydro; Oil producing countries; Renewable energies; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy potentials; Solar; Geothermal energy","","","","","","","CIA World Factbook; Encyclopedia Britannica; Zarakhovich Y., Kazakhstan comes on strong, Time, (2006); Investment Climate and Market Structure Review in the Energy Sector of Kazakhstan, (2013); Renewable Energy Snapshot, (2013); Karatayev M., Clarke M.L., A review of current energy systems and green energy potential in Kazakhstan, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 55, pp. 491-504, (2016); KazEnergy; Prospective of windpower development in Kazakhstan, UNDP-GEF; Wind energy, KZgreenenergy.com; Bolotov A.V., Bolotov S.A., Schoolnik V.S., Unlimited resources of alternative power, Kazakhstan Power & Renewable Energy Investment Conference; Development of Solar Energy in Kazakhstan: Reality and Prospects; Karatayev M., Clarke M.L., Current energy resources in Kazakhstan and the future potential of renewables: A review, Energy Procedia, 59, pp. 97-104, (2014); Hong E., Future of renewable energy in Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies, Delovoi Kazakhstan; Tuleubayeva R., Example of a Government Support Program Based on Fixed RES Tariffs, (2016); About support of use of renewable sources of energy, Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan, (2009)","A.

Conflicts may take place between or within countries or between competing sectoral users. This paper focuses on institutional approaches for enhancing cooperation between countries for sustainable development of transboundary freshwater bodies and contributing basins. It is assumed that instead of being zones of conflict, shared water resources can provide a basis for cooperation and benefit-sharing provided that threats to the international waters are recognized and collaborative structures are created. The paper draws upon experiences gained within the international waters focal area of the Global Environment Facility, the main funding mechanism for countries to support the environmental management of transboundary water resources. Lessons for promoting peaceful cooperation for environmental management, benefit-sharing and sustainable use of transboundary freshwater resources are highlighted through examples from Africa, Central Asia and Latin America. Experience shows the importance of processes that bring together all sectors and actors whose actions affect the transboundary waterbody at regional, national and local levels. The development of a science-based diagnostic analysis is essential to identify the threats to the transboundary ecosystem and to break down the issues into manageable parts with the aim of developing a strategic action programme. Ensuring political commitment that can result in institutional, policy and legal reforms in the countries concerned is the key to sustainable development of the transboundary resource.","Aral Sea; Bermejo River; Conflict prevention; Global Environment Facility; Lake Tanganyika; Transboundary water resources","international cooperation; resource allocation; transboundary cooperation; water management; water resource","","","","","","","Bewers J.M., Uitto J.I., International waters program study, Evaluation Report #1-01 Global Environment Facility, (2001); Biswas A.K., Water for urban areas of the developing world in the twenty-first century, Water for Urban Areas: Challenges and Perspectives, pp. 1-23, (2000); Duda A.M., Achieving pollution prevention goals for transboundary waters through international joint commission processes, Water Science and Technology, 30, pp. 223-231, (1994); Duda A.M., EI-Ashry M.T., Addressing the global water and environment crises through integrated approaches to the management of land, water and ecological resources, Water International, 25, pp. 115-126, (2000); Duda A.M., La Roche D., Joint institutional arrangements for addressing transboundary water resources issues - Lessons for the GEF, Natural Resources Forum, 21, pp. 127-137, (1997); Operational Strategy, (1996); Glantz M.H., Creeping environmental problems in the Aral Sea basin, Central Eurasian Water Crisis: Caspian, Aral, and Dead Seas, pp. 25-52, (1998); Glazovsky N.F., The Aral Sea basin, Regions at Risk: Comparisons of Threatened Environments, pp. 92-139, (1995); Homer-Dixon T., The Myth of Global Water Wars, pp. 10-13, (1999); The Regional Impacts of Climate Change: An Assessment of Vulnerability, (2001); Mageed Y.A., The Nile basin: Lessons from the past, International Waters of the Middle East from Euphrates-Tigris to Nile, pp. 156-184, (1994); Transboundary Environmental Analysis, (2001); Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis of the Binational Basin of the Bermejo River, (2000); Ollila P., Uitto J.I., Crepin C., Duda A.M., Multicountry Project Arrangements: Report of a Thematic Review, (2000); Rangeley R., Thiam B.M., Andersen R.A., Lyle C.A., International River Basin Organizations in Sub-Saharan Africa, (1994); Renner M., Fighting for Survival: Environmental Decline, Social Conflict and the New Age of Insecurity, (1996); Sjoberg H., Restructuring the Global Environment Facility, (1999); Uitto J.I., Population, food and water in the 21st century, Population Problems: Topical Issues, pp. 93-110, (2000); Uitto J.I., Global freshwater resources, World Forests, Markets and Policies, pp. 65-76, (2001); Uitto J.I., Multi-country co-operation for sustainable development of international lake basins: Lessons from the Global Environment Facility, Lakes and Reservoirs As International Water Systems, pp. 79-93, (2002); Uitto J.I., Environmental disaster feeds terrorism, The Japan Times, (2002); World Demographic Trends, (1997); Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater Resources of the World, (1997); Wolf A.T., Natharius J.A., Danielson J.J., Ward B.S., Pender J.K., International river basins of the world, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 15, pp. 387-427, (1999); Dams and Development - A New Framework for Decision-Making, (2000); A Water Secure World - Vision for Water, Life, and the Environment, (2000)","J.I.

Law always had a regard for nature, as the ancient Chinese pictogram for the law, FA, makes clear. However, until the late nineteenth century, law took nature for granted. As the industrial revolution emerged, as the scientific revolution brought to Earth the perspectives from space, and as human populations placed unprecedented demands on Earth’s natural resources to meet human needs and wants, humans began to induce an evolution in the planet. Deserts have grown, the Aral Sea has dried up, species have become extinct, urban settlements have become vast conurbations producing ever greater demands for housing, food stuffs, jobs, potable water, and energy. It is not only natural that the field of law should address these phenomena, as a matter of simple justice law it must. No international authority mandated that the field of environmental law should be established. The field emerged in the 1970s, and now exists in all nations and as a growing element of international law. As the norms of environmental law have made clear, it also has become clear that much of the implementation of these norms remains unrealized. Much of this is due to the lack of trained personnel and deficiencies in the legislation comprising the first generation of environmental laws. © IUCN and Cambridge University Press, 2005.","","","","","","","","","Sands P., Principles of International Environmental Law, (2003); Kiss A.-C., The Protection of the Environment and International Law, (1975); Lavietes S., Gilbert kerlin, 94, riverdale conservator, dies, New York Times, (2004); Holdgate M., The Green Web, (1999)","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","978-051151138-7; 0521845254; 978-052184525-0","","","English","The Law of Energy for Sustainable Development","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926963801"

The collapse of the Soviet Union left the issue under the purview of international law. This essay addresses how this shift has affected attempts to slow or reverse the sea's depletion. Treaties on the non-navigation use of international watercourses and on the prevention of desertification have had little effect. While a number of regional instruments and arrangements have been brought to bear, they have also done little to reverse damage to the sea. Finally, attempts to regulate the issue through domestic law, as evidenced in the case of Kyrgyzstan, have done little as well. While some progress has recently been made under the auspices of the World Bank, it is not a result of international law. The conclusion is that the shift from domestic to international law has little improved the situation, and may have made matters worse.","Agriculture; Amu Darya; Aral Sea; Desertification; International law; Irrigation; Syr Darya","Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; Kyrgyzstan; Sirdaryo; USSR; Uzbekistan; West Asia; desertification; disaster management; environmental management; international law; irrigation; Law of the Sea; marine environment; marine policy; World Bank","","","","","","","Akmansoy S., McKinney D.C., Aral Sea Water Rights, (1997); Burns W.C., The International Convention to Combat Desertification: Drawing a line in the sand?, Michigan Journal of International Law, 16, pp. 831-882, (1995); Clark L.C., The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the new partnership for Africa's development, Seattle University Law Review, 27, pp. 525-555, (2003); Danish K.W., International environmental law and the 'bottom up' approach: A review of the Desertification Convention, Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, 3, pp. 133-176, (1995); Elhance A.P., Conflict and cooperation over water in the Aral Sea basin, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 20, pp. 207-218, (1997); Iles A., The Desertification Convention: A deeper focus on social aspects of environmental degradation?, Harvard International Law Journal, 36, pp. 207-219, (1995); Central Asia: Water and Conflict, (2002); The Curse of Cotton: Central Asia's Destructive Monoculture, (2005); Kemelova D., Zhalkubaev G., Water, conflict and regional security in Central Asia revisited, New York University Environmental Law Journal, 11, pp. 479-502, (2003); McCaffrey S.C., Water, water everywhere, but too few drops to drink: The coming fresh water crisis and international environmental law, Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 28, pp. 325-337, (2000); McCaffrey S.C., The Law of International Watercourses: Non-Navigational Uses, (2003); McKinney D.C., Cooperative management of transboundary water resources in Central Asia, In the Tracks of Tamerlane, pp. 187-219, (2004); Mickin P.P., Desiccation of the Aral Sea: A water management disaster in the Soviet Union, Science, 241, pp. 1170-1176, (1988); Peachey E.J., The Aral Sea basin crisis and sustainable water resource management in Central Asia, Journal of Public and International Affairs, 15, pp. 1-20, (2004); Sandbank L., Dirty laundry: Why international measures to save the global clean water supply have failed, Fordham Environmental Law Journal, 13, pp. 165-205, (2001); Seivers E.W., Water, conflict and regional security in Central Asia, New York University Environmental Law Journal, 10, pp. 356-402, (2002); Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, (2008); Status of Ratification and Entry Into Force, (2008); Vinogradov S., Langford V.P.E., Managing transboundary water resources in the Aral Sea basin: In search of a solution, International Journal of Global Environmental Issues, 1, 3, pp. 345-362, (2001); Wegerich K., Not a Simple Path: A Sustainable Future for Central Asia, (2001); Wegerich K., Coping with disintegration of a river-basin management system: Multidimensional issues in Central Asia, Water Policy, 6, pp. 335-344, (2004); Weiss E.B., Internatonal environmental law: Contemporary issues and the emergence of a new world order, Georgetown Law Journal, 81, pp. 675-710, (1992); Innovative approaches to ecosystem restoration: Kazakhstan's Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea Phase I Project, Water Feature Stories, 23, pp. 1-2, (2008)","","","","","","","","","14653354","","","","English","Cent.

In the authors' analysis, the most pressing current environmental problems are the loss of biodiversity and the complexity of the network of protected natural areas; insufficient levels of municipal solid waste processing; energy efficiency problems, in particular, the deterioration of the energy production and supply system; the imbalance between hydropower, irrigated agriculture and the environment; and problems of the Aral Sea. The article proposes solutions, including amendments to the legislation, the adoption of managerial decisions, and strengthening judicial control over compliance with the law. This article examines gaps in the legislative regulation of environmental safety and in policies at the national, regional and international levels. It also identifies future trends in the distribution of global resources that will be effective in protecting the environment, including the activities of the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC). It also analyses the basic environmental rights of citizens as well as cases and consequences of violation of such rights, focusing on the need to inform citizens about the state of the environment and existing environmental problems, which is now the aim of the regional environmental remediation programme, led by the EU.  © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

Witte Moscow University, Moscow, Russian Federation","Nowadays many scientists and specialists say that in the twenty-first century, not hydrocarbons but water will be the key issue for economic development, well-being, and quality of life. This fully applies to the Central Asian countries where historically the problems of water resources have been in the focus of attention as the main factors determining stability in all sectors of the economy. This is connected with their geographical location and specific natural conditions. The Central Asian states locate in a region with severe climate featuring very high temperatures, uneven spatial distribution of water resources, and their insufficiency as no mechanism for addressing water issues is available. By the early twenty-first century, all water supply reserves in the region have been practically exhausted. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the river basins in this region are transboundary and their watersheds do not coincide with the existing state borders. In addition, the economies of the Central Asian countries depend enormously on the use of transboundary water resources adding complexity to the water relations among these states which may be fraught with ethnic and social conflicts. The problem is aggravated by differing hydropower priorities of the countries located in the upper reaches of rivers, such as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan that control more than 80% of all freshwater supplies, and agricultural needs of the downstream countries – Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. In other words, some of the countries need electricity, while others water for irrigated farming. This problem remains in the focus of attention due to a number of factors typical of the Central Asian region: the apparent political stability of local elites tested periodically by civil confrontations, “smoldering” military conflict in adjacent Afghanistan, high population growth rates, and the presence of ecological disaster zones – drying up of the Aral Sea, desertification, etc. In addition, water management in the Central Asian countries is being adapted to the new economic conditions. There are also the imbalance between the number of the population and the amount of available resources required to meet their vital needs (food, water, etc.), acceleration of climate change processes leading to the growing number of extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts, and contamination of water sources resulting in deteriorated sanitary conditions. Fair and sustainable management of shared water resources requires legal regulation, the institutions that are capable to ensure the holistic approach to this problem, and effective methods for solving it. Regardless of the surviving problems, the international experience has shown that in case of joint management of transboundary river basins, the interstate water conflicts usually tend to give way to cooperation. Depending on the emerging political situation, water problems can be a factor of rapprochement or disintegration of the Central Asian states. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Central Asia; Conflicts; Cooperation; Hydropower; Irrigation; Security; Transboundary rivers","","","","","","","","Mukhabbatov K.M., Water problems of Tajikistan and water use problems in Central Asia, J Post-Soviet Issues, 3, pp. 29-45, (2016); Sedov D., Central Asia – there will be no wars for water resources, Foundation for Strategic Culture, (2012); Mukhabbatov K.M., Problems of Nature Management in Mountainous Regions of Tajikistan, (2015); Zhiltsov S.S., Zonn I.S., The struggle for water, J Secur Index, 3, pp. 49-62, (2008); Belyy V.A., Influence of demographic factors on the formation of social conflicts (On the example of the Fergana Valley), J Actual Probl Humanit Soc Econ Sci, 11, pp. 39-43, (2017); Pikulina M.L., The problem of transboundary water resources in Central Asia, J Kazakhstan Spectr, 1, pp. 31-42, (2013); Iskandarhonova B.A., Legal regulation of the use of transboundary rivers in Central Asia, Moscow J Int Law, 3, pp. 140-153, (2007); Kuzmina E.M., Geopolitics of Central Asia, (2007); Huseynov V., Goncharenko A., Water resources of Central Asia.

Those developments prompted the idea of organizing the seminar, with the view of looking at international watercourses as a concept from both an intellectual and operational viewpoint. The structure of this report reflects the organization and design of the seminar that was held on November 3-4, 1997. The first part of the report deals with the regulatory framework for international watercourses. Chapter 1 provides an historical and conceptual context for the regulation and uses of international watercourses. Chapter 2 introduces the UN convention on the law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses, gives an overview of its provisions and discusses its prospects and pitfalls. Both chapters discuss the controversial areas of the convention, and explain how such controversies and disagreements were addressed. The second part of the report deals with the bank policy for projects on international waterways. Chapter 3 traces the history and evolution of the policy, analyzes its basic concepts and details the inter-relationship between the evolution of the policy and the development of international law in this area. The third part of the report deals with international watercourses and the environment. Chapter 4 presents the strategies adopted recently for protecting the environment of international watercourses in Europe, specially with the challenges posed by the break-up of the Soviet Union, and the resulting expansion of the membershhip of the economic commission for Europe. The chapter reviews and analyzes the recently adopted conventions: the Helsinki convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses, and international lakes and the Espoo convention on environmental impact assessment, and highlights the problems and the prospects for those conventions. Chapter 5 traces the environmental problems of the Aral Sea, how they were exacerbated, and discusses the dangers posed by such problems. The chapter discusses the Aral Sea basin program and its objectives, as well as the institutional, legal and financial pre-requisites for implementing the program. Chapter 6 deals with the problems being faced in the management of international water in Africa, with particular emphasis on the Volta Basin, Lake Victoria and the international rivers within SADC. It describes the stresses (water scaricity, drought, watershed and aquatic ecosystems degradation) which have emerged as a result of uncoordinated use of resources, and capacity imbalances within each case, and suggests the lesson that can be learnt from those three case studies. The fourth part of the report deals with conflict resolution of international watercourses. Chapter 7 deals with the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dispute between Hungary and Slovakia over whether or not to build two barrages on the Danube river, and the decision of the International Court of Justice thereon. The chapter describes the considerable extent to which the court has bone towards developing the law in relation to international watercourses and the need to protect the environment. Chapter 8 describes the origins of the dispute between India and Balgladesh over the Ganges river, the previous attempts to resolve the dispute, and the reasons for the failure of such attempts. It reviews and analyzes the provisions of the recently concluded treaty, and discusses the dynamics of implication of the treaty in its first year, and the implications for the future. Chapter 9 traces the roots of the dispute between India and Pakistan over the Indus Basin and describes the role of the World Bank in resolving the dispute and in the conclusion of the Indus Treaty. The chapter concludes with an analysis of the reason for the success of the bank in the Indus Basin. The conclusion underscores the importance of international legal norms, reflected in the UN convention and the various regional and bilateral instruments, in enhancing cooperation and managing conflict over international watercourses. It also argues that these instruments demonstrate a trend towards more comprehensive strategies for managing and protecting international watercourses.","","conflict resolution; geopolitics; international cooperation; water resources","","","","","","","Conley A., A Synoptic View of Water Resources in Southern Africa, (1995); Grey D., Sadoff C., A Water Resources Management Assistance Strategy for Southern Africa Development Community Member States, (1996); Hirji R., River Basin Management in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges and Opportunities, (1995); Hirji R., Duda A., A Comprehensive Approach for Managing the Lake Victoria Basin Ecosystem, Nile 2002 Conference, (1995); Kirmani S., Rangeley R., International Inland Waters: Concepts for a More Active World Bank Role, (1994); Rangeley R., Et al., International River Basin Organizations in Sub-Saharan Africa, (1994); Sharma N., Et al., African Water Resources: Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Development, (1996); Trolldalen J.M., International Environmental Conflict Resolution: The Role of the United Nations, (1992); Water Resources Management, (1993); Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda: Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project, (1996); Biswas A., Indus Water Treaty: The Negotiating Process, Water Int'l, 17, (1992); Gulahti N.D., Indus Waters Treaty, (1973); Lilienthal D.E., Another 'Korea' in the Making?, Collier's, 128, (1951); Michel A.A., The Indus Rivers, (1967); Mosley L., The Last Days of the British Raj, pp. 198-199, (1962); Rao K.L., India's Water Wealth, pp. 203-205, (1975)","","","","","","","","","02537494","","","","English","World Bank Tech.

This is particularly essential in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where ineffective water management institutions are the primary reason of intersectoral and inter-state water sharing conflicts and lack of incentives for improving water use efficiency. This study examined market-based water allocation as an alternative option to the traditional administrative allocation to deal with water scarcity issues in the ASB. Potential economic gains of tradable water use rights were analyzed based on a newly constructed integrated hydro-economic river basin management model. The analysis differentiates between inter-catchment and intra-catchment water rights trading. The results show that compared to a baseline with fixed water use rights, inter-catchment water rights trading can increase basin-wide benefits by US$ 373-476million. Under intra-catchment trading, gains are still US$ 259-339million, depending on relative water availability. Gains from trade are larger under drier conditions. However, water rights trading carries a series of transaction costs. We find that in case transaction costs exceed US$ 0.05/m3 of water traded there is no additional economic gain from water rights trading. Enforcement of the rule of law, infrastructural improvements, participation of representatives of key water stakeholders in decision making processes, and mutual trust and cooperative relationships among the riparian countries are suggested as means for reducing transaction costs of water rights trading contracts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Hydro-economic model; Inter-catchment and intra-catchment water rights trading; Transaction costs","Aral Sea; Catchments; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Economics; International law; Laws and legislation; Population statistics; Runoff; Water management; Cooperative relationships; Decision making process; Economic modeling; Industrial development; River basin management; Sustainable management; Transaction cost; Water rights; decision making; incentive; law enforcement; sustainable development; transaction cost; water demand; water management; water planning; water resource; Water resources","","","","","International Water Management Institute; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","The study is the result of a dissertation supported by the IPSWaT (International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies) program of BMBF (German Ministry of Education and Research).

This article outlines the basic definitions, goals, objectives, approaches, principles and methods that should be taken as a basis when designing the management mechanism applicable to water resources of Transboundary Rivers of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Researching has contributed to an original vision of theoretical and methodological fundamentals of water resources management and of its mechanism at the national level with regard to the principles of integrated basin management. It has also contributed to the original solutions made for the problems of their improvement. The stated research goals and objectives were achieved through the following methods: historical-chronological, abstract-logical, analytical-monographic, structural-functional, statistical methods. This article examines the problem of transboundary water resources management from top to bottom with regard to the outlined management principles, methods and mechanism through the example of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Hence, practical research relevance is that it introduces science-based recommendations on water resources management in Kazakhstan that are driven by the latest acceptable methods and mechanisms. The introduced economic mechanism of transboundary water resources management was designed for the Central Asia countries to boost the process of solving problems of rational utilization and protection of water resources, sustainable water management and stabilization of the Aral Sea level by means of legal, administrative, economic and technical methods. © 2018 Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

Although it has been recurrently mentioned that a reduction in water supply will hamper irrigation in the downstream countries, the magnitude of associated economic losses, economy-wide repercussions on employment rates, and degradation of irrigated lands has not been quantified as yet. A computable general equilibrium model is used to assess the economy-wide consequences of a reduced water supply in Uzbekistan—a country that encompasses more than half of the entire irrigated croplands in Central Asia. Modeling findings showed that a 10–20 % reduction in water supply, as expected in the near future, may reduce the areas to be irrigated by 241,000–374,000 hectares and may cause unemployment to a population of 712–868,000, resulting in a loss for the national income of 3.6–4.3 %. A series of technical, financial, and institutional measures, implementable at all levels starting from the farm to the basin scale, are discussed for reducing the expected water risks. The prospects of improving the basin-wide water management governance, increasing water and energy use efficiency, and establishing the necessary legal and institutional frameworks for enhancing the introduction of needed technological and socioeconomic change are argued as options for gaining more regional water security and equity. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Abandonment of land; Agriculture; Agroprocessing; Aral Sea Basin; Computable general equilibrium model; National income; Unemployment","","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, Uni Bonn; Zentrum für Entwicklungsforschung, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, ZEF","Data for this research were collected as part of a Ph.D. research at the Center for Development Research (ZEF) of Bonn University, supported by the IPSWaT research scholarship of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Confronted with unsustainable economic practices, environmental degradation and serious social problems, the Aral Sea Basin states seek to develop an effective legal and institutional framework for the cooperative management of scarce water resources. Up to date information on the environmental, economic and human conditions in the Aral Sea Basin provides the context for an analysis of efforts to manage transboundary water resources in the Soviet period and among the independent republics. The most recent draft agreements and initiatives among the Aral Sea Basin states are reviewed from the perspective of legal and institutional effectiveness, with reference to the principles of international water law. Finally, recent attempts to meet the needs of all riparians through trade in natural resources are viewed as a promising development. This strategy could provide solutions based on a more holistic approach to natural resources, while recognizing the historical, geopolitical and natural characteristics of the region. © 2001 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Aral Sea; dispute resolution; institution building; regional cooperation; water law","","","","","","","","Berkoff J., Dukhovny V., Sokolov V., Interstate water allocation: an analysis of the Aral Sea Basin experience, Nat.

It comprises a large-scale irrigation system that conveys water from the river Amu Darya to agricultural land cropped mainly with cotton, wheat, and rice. Khorezm's water resources are vulnerable as they depend on upstream developments and are indispensable to rural livelihoods and state budgets. Since water scarcity is expected to increase in the future, sustainable water management is a necessity. Hence, the objectives of the paper are to: (1) conceptualize the distinctive features of water management in Khorezm; (2) provide an integrated analysis of water management by establishing linkages between society, technical infrastructure, and the bio-physical environment; and (3) make policy and technology recommendations for improved water management. To conceptualize water management in Khorezm, the paper distinguishes three types of practices: formal practices, strategic practices, and discursive practices. Based on these, it presents an analysis of water management on the state water management level, the water user association level, and the farmer and field level. For each level, recommendations are given. The paper concludes that elements of integrated water resources management (IWRM) such as transparency, accountability, participation, and technical efficiency are relevant to improve water management in Khorezm, as elsewhere. In addition, it underlines the need to create legal space for agency and innovation. Technical tools such as models are increasingly important for facilitating transparency and enabling agents to access and make use of information across the management hierarchy. © 2011 The Authors.
