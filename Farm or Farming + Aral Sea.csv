Options for diversification and its associated drivers might be shaped by livelihood context, and it remains as a general gap in knowledge. This study aimed to reveal the driving factors behind households’ decisions to diversify their crops in different livelihood contexts. This information could be useful to inform stakeholders on a set of context-fitted options for improving natural resources and rural livelihood resilience to climatic variability and risks. This study applied the Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF) to guide surveys and multivariate analyses that identified agricultural livelihood context types at the village level, and also evaluated both the common and type-specific drivers encouraging households to diversify their agricultural production in two rural villages in the Aral Sea region. This study objectively identified three distinct agricultural livelihood types and the main factors differentiating these types from each other. When the total sampled population was analyzed, the results indicated that the agricultural experience of the household heads, levels of education, sources of income, number of cattle and land endowments, and proximity to markets were common and significant drivers in diversifying these households’ crop production. Analyzing the decisions behind diversifying crop production for each agricultural livelihood type revealed type-specific drivers of diversification. The findings suggested that considering both common and type-specific drivers of diversification would allow better understanding of household decisions and provide more insights to develop effective policies promoting climate-smart agriculture through diversification, rather than continuing to use the current “uniform blanket” approach. © 2022 by the authors.","agricultural livelihood system; Aral Sea Basin Region; diversification; household; Karakalpakstan; smallholder","Aral Sea; agricultural development; agricultural diversification; crop production; household energy; livelihood; smallholder","","","","","Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, CGIAR","This research was funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems led by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA).

Through a modified systematic review of scholarly literature, an inventory of 246 ancient and modern examples of settlement abandonment was generated. Common spatial and temporal parameters were identified and a typology created to summarize environmental and non-environmental drivers common across cases. Dynamic interactions of drivers that lead to a progression from vulnerability to population decline and abandonment were examined in the cases of Plymouth, Montserrat, abandoned due to volcanism in the 1990s; recent rural depopulation in northeastern Iraq and the southern marshes; outmigration from the southern Aral Sea region; and, neighbourhood abandonment and a proposal to convert abandoned lands in Detroit to commercial farming. The study finds that with growing vulnerability to environmental change across many regions, there is greater potential for increased numbers of abandonments. However, abandonment should be seen as only one possible outcome of environment and population interactions that create vulnerability and stimulate environmental migration. The study concludes with a series of observations relevant to anticipating and planning for potential population decline and settlement abandonment in the face of future global environmental change. © 2011.","Adaptation; Environmental migration; Ghost towns; Population decline; Settlement abandonment; Vulnerability","Aral Sea; Detroit; England; Iraq; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Michigan; Montserrat; Plymouth [England]; United Kingdom; United States; abandoned land; adaptation; environmental change; environmental factor; human settlement; internal migration; literature review; marsh; population decline; spatiotemporal analysis; typology; volcanism; vulnerability","","","","","Government of the United Kingdom","This research was supported financially by the United Kingdom Government Office for Science through the Foresight project on environmental migration.

Large-scale cotton production utilizes the practices of conventional agriculture and has severe environmental consequences in arid regions. Some of these problems, such as salinization, currently exist in Uzbekistan as a result of cotton production and these conventional farming practices. This chapter is a review of cotton production, the environmental consequences of conventional agriculture, and its relationship to the Aral Sea Disaster. Storm water management with biofiltration, sustainable farming practices, efficient irrigation, ecological horticultural practices, and a water conservation program are remedies that can help to reduce the environmental degradation caused by cotton production and restore some of the water resources in Uzbekistan.

Regional climate change, already evident, is likely to exacerbate droughts and high summer temperatures; the future rainfall regime is unknown. All these hazards will increase the risk of land degradation. The Aral Sea has been declared a zone of environmental innovation and technology but, beyond sowing halophytes in its dry bed, we are a long way from restoration. New and different ways have to be found to combat these challenges including science-based crop rotation taking into account soil characteristics; sustainable farming systems adapted to the harsh landscape; widespread adoption of agro-ecotechnology, biotechnology and information technology in soil conservation and land use planning; and effective ways to combat salinization, erosion, depletion of soil organic matter, and compaction. All need a sound theoretical base. Innovations under trial include soil improvement with a range of vegetable crops and legumes, application of various composts including worm compost from household waste and biogas production residue, microbiological preparations, and systematic reclamation of gypsum soils. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Fisheries have been stranded miles from the shore, and increasing salinity levels mean that fewer and fewer fish are surviving each year. The salt pan left behind by the shrinking Sea is unable to support any plant life, and wind sweeps across the entire area producing salt and sand storms which poison acres of arable land. The Aral Sea's regulating effect on the region's climate is diminishing with its reduction in size, producing adverse weather conditions in the area. The region's cotton and rice production require considerable application of pesticide, which becomes trapped and accumulates in this hydrologically closed basin; groundwater contamination is leading to increasing incidence of cancer, liver and kidney disease and child mortality. One hundred Soviet scientists attended a meeting to formulate a strategy for reversing the decline in the area, their proposals included: charging farmers for water; creating a regionally integrated water management plan; and instituting a broad-based family planning effort - all under the control of a basin-wide authority, representing the five affected republics. However, an alternative plan is also under consideration, which involves the diversion of water from Siberian rivers in the north. -M.Z.Barber","","Aral Sea; Kazakhstan; Uzbekistan; ecological degradation; environmental impact; irrigation project; man-environment relations; policy response; semiarid area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026281876"

Competition for water is increasing in the central Asian countries in the Aral Sea Basin since they became independent in 1991. Disputes have developed between the three downstream countries, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and the two upstream countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, in the basin in sharing water in its two main rivers, Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The downstream countries are heavy consumers of water for growing cotton while the upstream countries want to use more water for electricity generation and farming. Accordingly, GMCR II is utilized as a formal mechanism for better understanding the complex conflict existing at present among countries along the Syr Darya and for providing insights as to how these countries may interact with one another in attempting to reach a resolution acceptable to all. In particular, strictly following the present water allocation agreement by all parties is found to be the most preferred resolution for both the upstream and downstream countries. © 2007 ASCE.","Asia; Decision support systems; International factors; Water resources","Aral Sea; Asia; Eurasia; Kazakhstan; Sirdaryo; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; West Asia; Decision support systems; Graphic methods; Rivers; Water distribution systems; Water management; Gossypium hirsutum; Decision support systems; Graphic methods; Rivers; Water distribution systems; basin management; decision support system; international agreement; river management; strategic approach; water use; Conflict resolution; Water allocation agreement; Water management","","","","","","","Antipova E., Zyrynov A., McKinney D., Savitsky A., Optimization of Syr Darya water and energy uses, Water Int., 27, 4, pp. 504-516, (2002); Arnold T., Theory, history and the Western waterscape: The market culture thesis, J. of the Southwest, 38, 2, pp. 215-240, (1996); Bazerman M.H., Neale M.A., Negotiating Rationally, (1993); Critchlow J., Nationalism in Uzbekistan, (1991); De Bono E., Conflicts: A Better Way to Resolve Them, (1985); Dukhovny V., Sokolov V., ""Lessons on Cooperation Building to Manage Water Conflicts in the Aral Sea Basin"", (2002); Fang L., Hipel K.W., Kilgour D.M., Interactive Decision Making: The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, (1993); Fang L., Hipel K.W., Kilgour D.M., Peng X., A decision support system for interactive decision making.

To improve the resilience of farming communities in the region, crop diversification is proposed to enable farmers to grow high-value competitive crops and obtain more stable farm incomes. This study provides long-term, multidisciplinary analyses and strategies for strengthening crop diversification amongst farmers in the Aral Sea region. The study analyzed data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the statistical yearbook of 2000–2020. According to the gross margin study findings, farmers who use diversified cropping systems made considerably higher revenues than farmers relying on mono-cropping practices. This study demonstrates that greater crop diversity contributes to the rational use of natural resources and optimization plans, environmental sustainability, and food security as important natural and socio-economic issues in this region. The study findings suggest that proper crop diversification strategies need to be developed in the Aral Sea region to improve the sustainability of farming systems with enhanced resilience to devastating environmental and climate challenges. © 2023 by the authors.","agriculture; Aral Sea region; crop diversification; farmers’ income; gross margin; Simpson Index; stress environment","Aral Sea; Uzbekistan; agricultural diversification; alternative agriculture; cropping practice; farm; food security; income; long-term change; optimization; sustainability","","","","","Abu-Dabi Development bank","This study was funded by the Abu-Dabi Development bank within the project entitled: Development of Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems in Degraded areas of Karakalpakstan.","Khaitov B., Karimov A.A., Toderich K., Sultanova Z., Mamadrahimov A., Allanov K., Islamov S., Adaptation, grain yield and nutritional characteristics of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) genotypes in marginal environments of the Aral Sea basin, J.

This study aims to clarify the drivers of water stress across the 440 km Naryn River basin, headwater stem to the Syr Darya and the disappearing North Aral Sea. We use a combination of human and physical geography approaches to understand the meltwater-controlled hydrology of the system (using hydrochemical mixing models) as well as the human-water experience (via community surveys). Surveys indicate that current water stress is primarily a function of water management and access issues resulting from the clunky transition from Soviet era large-scale agriculture to post-Soviet small-plot farming. Snow and ice meltwaters play a dominant role in the surface and ground water supplies to downstream communities across the study's 4220 m elevation gradient, so future increases to water stress due to changes in volume and timing of water supply is likely given frozen waters' high sensitivities to warming temperatures. The combined influence of social, political and climate-induced pressures on water supplies in the Naryn basin suggest the need for proactive planning and adaptation strategies, and warrant concern for similar melt-sourced Central Asian watersheds. © 2017 by the authors.","Aral sea basin; Central asia; Cryosphere; Downstream water vulnerability; Glacial runoff; Groundwater; Meltwater; Mountain hydrology","Aral Sea; Kyrgyzstan; Naryn Basin; Sirdaryo; Uzbekistan; Groundwater; Hydrology; Surveys; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Aral Sea; Central Asia; Cryosphere; Glacial runoff; Meltwater; Mountain hydrology; Water vulnerabilities; cryosphere; glacial hydrology; groundwater flow; headwater; hydrochemistry; meltwater; runoff; vulnerability; water management; water stress; water supply; Water resources","","","","","","","Barnett T.P., Adam J.C., Lettenmaier D.P., Potential impacts of a warming climate on water availability in snow-dominated regions, Nature, 438, pp. 303-309, (2005); Hennessy K.B., Fitzharris B., Bates B.C., Harvey N., Howden M., Hughes L., Salinger J., Warrick R., Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change, (2007); Parry M., Canziani O., Palutikof J., van der Linden P., Hanson C., (2007); Immerzeel W.W., van Beek L.P.H., Bierkens M.F.P., Climate Change Will Affect the Asian Water Towers, Science, 328, (2010); Wilson A.M., Gladfelter S., Williams M.W., Shahi S., Baral P., Armstrong R., Racoviteanu A., High Asia: The International Dynamics of Climate Change and Water Security, J.

This study deals with the question of how farmers in Khorezm perceive water and its management and how this facilitates or prevents water conservation, or ""water saving,"" in irrigated agriculture. To answer this from the perspective of the water users, we apply Schütz's lifeworld concept to the study of natural-resource management, thereby reconstructing the water lifeworld of Khorezmian farmers. We present the spatial and temporal boundaries of the water lifeworld; the different types of water, people, and land that farmers distinguish; and the institutions water management is based on. The analysis shows that religious values and the risk of being fined for water wasting facilitate water saving. However, the following barriers to water saving dominate farmer practices: (1) storage of saved water is not possible, (2) using much water creates social capital, (3) perceived water needs exceed the geographical realities, (4) the term ""water saving"" is not in use, and (5) farmers believe that water management is the state's responsibility. We conclude that water saving should be facilitated by environmental education, a strengthening of the water-inspection department Uzsuvnazorat, and the creation of decentralized storage options. © 2011, by the Rural Sociological Society.","","Khorazm; Uzbekistan; agricultural worker; conservation; irrigation; social capital; water management; water storage; water use","","","","","","","Abdullaev I., Mollinga P., The Socio-technical Aspects of Water Management: Emerging Trends at Grass Roots Level in Uzbekistan, Water, 2, 1, pp. 85-100, (2010); Abdullaev I., Nurmetova F., Abdullaeva F., Lamers J., Socio-technical Aspects of Water Management in Uzbekistan: Emerging Water Governance Issues at the Grass Root Level, Central Asian Waters: Social, Economic, Environmental and Governance Puzzle, pp. 89-103, (2008); Adoment M., Umweltkommunikation in der Landwirtschaft-Eine empirische Untersuchung der bäuerlichen Lebenswelt als kommunikative Lernsituation im Kontext nachhaltiger Entwicklung, (2004); Berger P., Luckmann T., Die Gesellschaftliche Konstruktion der Wirklichkeit-Eine Theorie der Wissenssoziologie, (1984); Butz D., Sustaining Indigenous Communities: Symbolic and Instrumental Dimensions of Pastoral Resource Use in Shmishal, Northern Pakistan, Canadian Geographer, 40, 1, pp. 36-53, (1996); Cleaver F., Reinventing Institutions: Bricolage and the Social Embeddedness of Natural Resource Management, European Journal of Development Research, 14, 2, pp. 11-30, (2002); Conrad C., (2006); Conti P.J., (2004); Dinar A., Subramanian A., Policy Implications from Water Pricing Experiences in Various Countries, Water Policy, 1, 2, pp. 239-250, (1998); Eberle T.S., Sinnkonstitution in Alltag und Wissenschaft, (1994); Esser H., The Rationality of Everyday Behaviour-A Rational Choice Reconstruction of the Theory of Action by Alfred Schütz, Rationality and Society, 5, 1, pp. 7-31, (1993); Flick U., von Kardorff E., Steinke I., A Companion to Qualitative Research, (2004); Forkutsa I., Sommer R., Shirokova Y.I., Lamers J.P.A., Kienzler K., Tischbein B., Martius C., Vlek P.L.G., Modelling Irrigated Cotton with Shallow Groundwater in the Aral Sea Basin of Uzbekistan: II.

This microlithic industry is characterized not by the size of the tools, but by the use of blades rather than flakes for the manufacture of stone tools. The prismatic core, often small and pencil-shaped, is very common; bifacial retouch is rare. The microliths are consistently found in association with pottery and bifacially worked projectile points of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of the third and second millennia B.C. The tendency of Soviet archaeologists to seek the ethnic affiliations of archaeological complexes may explain the considerable regional variation in pottery and stone tool inventories, but adjustment to environment is a more likely explanation for the wide-spread occurrence of the basic features of the microlithic industry. A way of life based on migratory hunting of small game and collecting developed as a result of refinements in missile weapons which included the bow and arrow. These developments can be correlated with the introduction of the microlithic blade technology. This way of life and the use of microliths survived in the steppe and desert areas, but in the regions to the south where farming developed the microliths were rapidly replaced by heavy tools such as hoes and pestles, and in the northern forests harpoons, fishhooks, and heavy wood-working tools indicate a shift to a more sedentary life based on intensive fishing. The widespread microlithic survivals in northern Asia demonstrate similar subsistence patterns in similar ecological zones rather than basic ethnic unity. Suggestions concerning origins, historical and cultural ties, and possible population movements are gradually emerging from detailed studies of the boundaries between the microlithic zone and the pottery and forest areas as well as from broader comparative analyses. © 1961 The Society for American Archaeology.","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","00027316","","","","English","Am.

Water is pervasive and failure to appreciate how water programmes fit within a broader economic, environmental and social context can incur large costs. Too often we outsiders, not to mention local politicians and bureaucrats, have been driven by our own thinking and interests, imposing approaches and solutions that may be appropriate in wealthier and more manageable situations but which fail to take into account the complexities of the vast regions of Asia and their huge populations, widespread poverty and traditional practices. The argument is illustrated in two ways. First by a brief review of programmes in five widely differing river basins: the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia; the Mahaweli Basin in Sri Lanka; the Ponniar Basin in South India; hydro-power development in Nepal and Bhutan; and the massive 3-H (Hai-Huang-Huai) basins of the North China Plain. This review illustrates how basin interventions can have profound implications for the development of whole regions, even countries, and that politicians and water professionals have too readily driven priorities that are insensitive to the real interests of the areas concerned, whether they involve action (as in the Aral Sea, Mahaweli and Ponniar cases) or inaction (as in Nepal). A measured approach (as in Bhutan and North China) within a broad understanding of the interests of the country or region concerned can have major benefits. Second, by an assessment of the irrigation sector. Irrigation is by far the largest water user and has played a central role in Asia's agricultural development, yet there has been surprisingly little progress in understanding how the prevailing context and associated incentives impact on farmer and official behaviour. This has, in my view, resulted in misjudgments concerning irrigation potential and returns. The issues are discussed under four headings: water use, crop output, institutional performance and irrigation modernisation. They may need modification in a warming world, but as they stand the paper's conclusions suggest that within its context Asian irrigation is more productive-and, dare I say it, efficient-than is commonly supposed. Failure to recognise this fact has led to unrealistic expectations from irrigation interventions and hence to wasted resources and effort.","Context; Experience; Irrigation; River basins; Water","Aral Sea; Asia; agricultural development; cost-benefit analysis; hydroelectric power; irrigation; poverty; prioritization; river basin; water economics; water industry; water resource","","","","","","","Molle F., Berkoff J., Irrigation water pricing: The gap between theory and practice, (2007); Berkoff J., Hydropower in Nepal and Bhutan: Why the difference, World Economics, 4, 3, pp. 121-142, (2003); Berkoff J., China: The south-north water transfer project-Is it justified, Water Policy, 5, 1, pp. 1-28, (2003); Berkoff J., Dukhovny V., Sokolov V., Interstate water allocation: An analysis of the Aral Sea Basin experience, (1997); Berkoff J., Are collective farms water user associations?

Once teeming with the fish that kept canneries humming and drew tourists from across the Soviet Union, the southern portion of the Aral is dead, dried up—a ghost of an inland sea. During World War I, fish were so plentiful that Russian train engines were adapted to burn fish that had been caught and dried for fuel (Bailey, 1946). But central planners in distant Moscow decided that it made economic and political sense to divert water from the two rivers that fed the Aral to irrigate the expanded cotton farming in the desert. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Eric Freedman and Mark Neuzil.","","","","","","","","","Bailey F.M., Mission to Tashkent, (1946); Baizakova Z., The irtysh and ili transboundary rivers: The kazakh-chinese path to compromise, George Washington University Institute for European, Russian, and EurAsian Studies, (2015); Bichsel C., Conflict Transformation in Central Asia: Irrigation Disputes in the Ferghana Valley, (2009); Brun A.H., Troublous Times: Adventures in Bolshevik Russia and Turkestan, (1931); De Martino L., Novikov V., Environment and security: Transforming risks into cooperation.

This model is used to formalize the structure of information and its life cycle, simulate processing processes, formalize the impact on information and the movement of information, taking into account the factors of adaptation of the EMIS to the structure of subject activity. Working with information allows you to process information processes and implement them in algorithmic, software and theoretical-analytical analysis. The presented information processing processes scheme is used to formalize information flows in the ecological monitoring information system. The aim of the study is that agricultural production is under heavy pressure based on world population growth and significant changes in climate. This study discusses the concept of digital agricultural practices and their impact on agricultural productivity. The assessment of the current situation is carried out by digitization in agricultural areas located in the Aral Sea region. The methodology is used in this study as a method to assess the current state of digital applications for agriculture in the Aral Sea region. Agriculture is one of the most suitable methods for it, as digitalization is still in its infancy in the Aral Sea region. Digital agricultural technologies in the Aral Sea region are at an early stage of development, and the topics discussed in the world are aimed at making significant progress in raising awareness about farmers and other sectors of agriculture in the Aral Sea region. Although the current penetration of digital technologies is not large enough in terms of volume and quantity, the analysis of the methods used for agriculture can achieve the expected results as a result of the experience of developed countries.  © 2021 IEEE.","datalogical model; ecological monitoring; infor-mation security; information processing; mathematical model; sensor","Agriculture; Ecology; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Monitoring; Population statistics; Security of data; Algorithmics; Analytical analysis; Aral Sea; Datalogical model; Ecological monitoring; Infor-mation security; Information process; Monitoring information system; Process information; Process schemes; Productivity","","","","","","","Kabulov A., Urunbayev E., Ashurov A., Logic method of finding maximum joint subsystems of systems of boolean equations, 2020 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies, Icisct, (2020); Kabulov A., Urunbaev E., Ashurov A., On functions correcting the sets of incorrect algorithms, 2020 International Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies, Icisct, (2020); Kabulov A., Normatov I., Seytov A., Kudaybergenov A., Optimal management of water resources in large main canals with cascade pumping stations, Iemtronics 2020-International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, Proceedings; Kabulov A., Saymanov I., Yarashov I., Muxammadiev F., Algorithmic method of security of the internet of things based on steganographic coding, Ieee International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, Iemtronics 2021-Proceedings, (2021); Kabulov A.V., Normatov I.H., Karimov A., Algorithmization control of complex systems based on functioning tables, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1441, 1; Kabulov A., Normatov I., Urunbaev E., Ashurov A., About the problem of minimal tests searching, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 12, pp. 10419-10430; Kabulov A., Normatov I., Karimov A., Navruzov E., Algorithm of constructing control models of complex systems in the language of functioning tables, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 12, pp. 10397-10417; Kabulov A.V., Urunbaev E., Normatov I., Ashurov A., Synthesis methods of optimal discrete corrective functions, Advances in Mathematics: Scientific Journal, 9, 9, pp. 6467-6482; Kabulov A., Urunbayev E., Ashurov A., Logical method for constructing the optimal corrector of fuzzy heuristic algorithms, Ternational Conference on Information Science and Communications Technologies: Applications Trends and Opportunities Icisct, (2019)","A.

As main water arteries for the Aral Sea, the Naryn and Syr Darya Rivers are managed between shifting alliances of the farming interests, International Non-governmental Organisation (INGO) bodies and national agencies of four riparian states. These Central Asian rivers have been subject to big dam-building programmes since the mid-Soviet period, while international companies now mine on the glaciers of the Naryn headwaters. I analyse socionatural water relations on a spectrum of three 'incarnations': first, river water as an exploitable resource; second, enspirited springs and lakes; and third, glaciers as indexes of human wrongdoing. While the multiplicity of water relations has been documented in many parts of the world, the concept of water incarnations highlights their topographical anchoring. This Central Asian case further shows how this anchoring can support claims of national entitlement. Finally, this paper argues that the situated heterogeneity of water relations can make it difficult to connect them to more sustainable water relationships in the region. © 2021, Water Alternatives.

The Hexi Corridor, the Yanqi Basin, the southeastern part of the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin became part of the empire. The expansion of the Han Dynasty was accompanied by the significant intensification of irrigation farming along rivers draining the Qilian, Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses and dating of lake sediments and shorelines revealed that four large lakes in the region experienced falling levels, or were almost or completely desiccating. The level of Zhuyeze Lake was falling rapidly ca. 2100 years before present (a BP), and the accumulation of lake sediments was replaced by an alluvial fan setting in large parts of the basin. Lake Eastern Juyan desiccated ca. 1700 a BP. Lake Bosten experienced low levels and increasing salinities at ca. 2200 a BP. Lake sediments in the Lop Nur region were mostly replaced by aeolian sands during a period of near-desiccation at 1800 a BP. In contrast, records from fifteen lakes farther in the west, north or south of the Han Dynasty realm indicate relatively wet climate conditions ca. 2000 years ago. Thus, dramatic landscape changes including the near and complete desiccation of large lakes in the arid western part of today’s China probably resulted from the withdrawal of water from tributaries during the Han Dynasty.

Site-specific factors that promote or hamper crop diversification after the dissolvent of the Soviet Union have hardly been assessed yet. While tapping the potential of remote sensing, the objective was to map and explain spatial patterns of current crop diversity by the example of the irrigated agricultural landscapes of the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Multi-temporal Landsat and RapidEye satellite data formed the basis for creating annual and multi-annual crop maps for 2010–2012 while using supervised classifications. Applying the Simpson index of diversity (SID) to circular buffers with radii of 1.5 and 5 km elucidated the spatial distribution of crop diversity at both the local and landscape spatial scales. A variable importance analysis, rooted in the conditional forest algorithm, investigated potential environmental and socio-economic drivers of the spatial patterns of crop diversity. Overall accuracy of the annual crop maps ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 whilst the SID varied between 0.1 and 0.85. The findings confirmed the existence of areas under monocultures as well as of crop diverse patches. Higher crop diversity occurred in the more distal parts of the irrigation system and sparsely settled areas, especially due to orchards. In contrast, in water-secure and densely settled areas, cotton-wheat rotations dominated due to the state interventions in crop cultivation. Distances to irrigation infrastructure, settlements and the road network influenced crop diversity the most. Spatial explicit information on crop diversity per se has the potential to support policymaking and spatial planning towards crop diversification. Driver analysis as exemplified at the study region in Uzbekistan can help reaching the declared policy to increase crop diversity throughout the country and even beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aral Sea Basin; Conditional inference trees; Conditional variable importance; Crop diversity; Crop rotations; Fergana Valley; Multi-sensor mapping; Random forest","Aral Sea; Ferghana Valley; Uzbekistan; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; agricultural land; biodiversity; crop plant; crop rotation; farming system; food security; irrigation system; mapping; remote sensing; satellite data; tree","","","","","","","Abdalla S., Leonhauser I., Bauer S., Elamin E., Factors influencing crop diversity in dry land sector of Sudan, Sky Journal of Agricultural Research, 2, 7, pp. 88-97, (2013); Abdullaev I., De Fraiture C., Giordano M., Yakubov M., Rasulov A., Agricultural water use and trade in Uzbekistan: Situation and potential impacts of market liberalization, International Journal of Water Resources Development, 25, 1, pp. 47-63, (2009); Awan U.K., Tischbein B., Conrad C., Martius C., Hafeez M., Remote sensing and hydrological measurements for irrigation performance assessments in a water user association in the lower Amu Darya river basin, Water Resources Management, 25, 10, pp. 2467-2485, (2011); Blaschke T., Object based image analysis for remote sensing, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65, pp. 2-16, (2010); Bobojonov I., Lamers J.P.A., Bekchanov M., Djanibekov N., Franz-Vasdeki J., Ruzimov J., Martius C., Options and constraints for crop diversification: A case study in sustainable agriculture in Uzbekistan, Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, 37, 7, pp. 788-811, (2013); Bowman M.S., Zilberman D., Economic factors affecting diversified farming systems, Ecology and Society, 18, 1, (2013); Breiman L., Random forest, Machine Learning, 45, 5, pp. 1-35, (1999); Breiman L., Manual on setting up, using, and understanding random forests v3. 1, (2002); Breiman L., Cutler A., Random forests-classification description, (2007); Bullock D., Crop rotation, Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 11, 4, pp. 309-326, (1992); Clement Y.M., Bhaduri A., Djanibekov N., Food price fluctuations in Uzbekistan: Evidence from local markets in 2002-2010, Restructuring land allocation, water use and agricultural value chains.

This prediction was tested with a metal assemblage consisting of numerous bronze and brass objects, mostly small items for personal use, excavated from the medieval (ca. 800–1000 AD) site near the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan. A technological transition driven by the growing reliance on brass was noted in the remarkable complexity in alloy recipes, in which recycled bronze and cementation brass served as the key materials along with elemental copper, tin, and lead. Different combinations of these materials were found to have resulted in the establishment of a dual technological tradition based on both bronze and brass. The notable transition and complexity as observed in the metal assemblage under consideration are interpreted as a reflection of the dynamic political settings in which both mobile pastoralist and sedentary farming groups were incorporated to form a dual social structure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Aral Sea region; Bronze and brass; Complexity; Medieval period; Technology; Transition","","","","","","Society for the Exploration of Eurasia; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF- 2017R1A2B4002082)","This work would not have been possible without the generous support of the late Dr. Karl Baipakov, the former director of the Margulan Institute of Archeology in Almaty, Kazakhstan and Dr. Christoph Baumer, the president of the Society for the Exploration of Eurasia.

At present, approximately 70% of the area in this study region is sown to irrigated cotton and winter wheat under the so-called state mandate. We present evidence of the benefits of moving away from this approach toward more diversified farming with an increasing area of alternative crops in the selected region. We report on a series of studies that included a) crop suitability screening based on secondary data, b) joint farmer experiments, and c) a mathematical simulation model with the overarching objective to assess potential benefits and constraints for crop diversification. The findings of this long-term, multiyear, and multidisciplinary approach show that greater crop diversity can increase water use efficiency, and secure farm income in dryland areas prone to water scarcity and soil salinity. In addition, the findings of the simulation model confirmed that crop diversification could secure income of downstream farmers during the climate-driven decline in water availability. Overall, the findings indicate that greater crop diversity and improved access to markets can lead to a sustainable development path in the region. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aral Sea Basin; Climate change; Diversification; Food security; Simpson index; Water shortage","","","","","","","","Ali M., Lumpkin T.A., Farooq U., Vegetable research and development in Central Asia: A guideline for setting priorities under data scarcity, Vegetable production in Central Asia: Status and perspectives, pp. 13-14, (2005); Begdullaeva T., Kienzler K.M., Kan E., Ibragimov N., Lamers J.P.A., Response of Sorghum bicolor varieties to soil salinity for feed and food production in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan, Irrigation and Drainage Systems, 21, pp. 237-250, (2007); Bekchanov M.B., Kan E., Lamers J.P.A., Options of agricultural extension provision for rural development in Central Asian transition economies: The case of Uzbekistan, pp. 72-83, (2009); Bobojonov I., Modeling crop and water allocation under uncertainty in irrigated agriculture: A case Study on the Khorezm Region, (2008); Bobojonov I., Franz J., Berg E., Lamers J.P.A., Martius C., Improved Policy making for sustainable farming: A Case study on irrigated dryland agriculture in western Uzbekistan, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, 34, pp. 800-817, (2010); Bobojonov I., Lamers J.P.A., Analysis of agricultural markets in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, Continuity and change: Land and water use reforms in rural Uzbekistan.

His first memory came in the decade after World War II ended and when the centralized economic expansion plans of the Soviet empire had only barely touched the remote valleys in southern Kyrgyzstan where tens of thousands of acres of Juglans regia grew. It was—and is—a complex ecosystem that also hosts apple, pear, and plum trees—130 species overall—and wild boars, deer, bears, owls, hawks, white woodpeckers, and other wildlife, as well as farmers, herders, and nomads descended from the tribes that roamed the region for centuries. “It was a paradise,” Shukurov, now in his 80s, recalled in an interview in late 2014.1 And he has more than a passing interest in the forests—a highly trained biologist, the tall, lean scientist has kept a critical eye on the area for almost sixty years. (The Soviets supported an experimental research station nearby in 1945 to start commercializing the timber and fruit.) He ticked off a list of environmental problems affecting the world’s largest walnut grove (150,000 acres, in several sections): Poaching of fruit and lumber, overgrazing, climate change, corrupt officials, poor resource management, and more. The Aral Sea is the media darling of Central Asia environmental problems. As we have seen, it gets rock-star attention, fueled in no small part by the arresting visual images of rusting, stranded fishing boats and a lake bottomturned- desert. But as the contributors in this volume have ably demonstrated, the list of environmental concerns in Central Asia is a long one, with difficult and multifaceted causes. The walnut forest, the largest patch of which is known as Arslanbob (27,000 acres), in Chapter 11 is a case in point. The trees hold a deep cultural significance among the local population. Most local schoolchildren know the story of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian king and military genius (356–323 bc) who conquered Persia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Bactria, and the Punjab but met his match on the plains of the mountains and steppes of Central and South Asia against its herders, tribespeople, and nomads as he marched to India. Battered, hungry, and facing a revolt in his ranks after outstripping his supply lines, the general and his army holed up in the walnut forest, nursing themselves back to life by eating its high-fat, high-protein nuts and hunting its game. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Eric Freedman and Mark Neuzil.","","","","","","","","","Adshead S., Central Asia in World History, (1993); Blaser J., Carter E.J., Gilmour D.A., Venglovsky B., Yunossova I., Biodiversity and Sustainable Use of Kyrgyzstan’s Walnut-Fruit Forests, (1998); Fairbrother M., Rich people, poor people, and environmental concerns: Evidence across nations and time, European Sociological Review, 29, 5, pp. 910-922, (2013); Worst of The Worst 2011: The World’s Most Repressive Societies, (2011); Freedom in the World 2015, (2015); Gascoigne C., New study: Crime, corruption, tax evasion drained a record us$991.2bn in illicit financial flows from developing economies in 2012, Global Financial Integrity, (2014); Shishkin P., Restless Valley: Revolution, Murder and Intrigue in the Heart of Central Asia, (2013); Soucek S., A History of Inner Asia, (2000); Corruption Perceptions Index 2013, (2013); Whitford A.B., Wong K., Political and social foundations for environmental sustainability, Political Research Quarterly, 62, 1, pp. 190-204, (2009)","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131783608-7; 978-113894855-6","","","English","Environmental Crises in Central Asia: From Steppes to Seas, from Deserts to Glaciers","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960361563"

With its food security depending almost entirely on irrigated agriculture, Central Asia is one of the arid regions highly vulnerable to water scarcity. Previous research of land and water use in the region has focused on improving water-use efficiency, soil management and identifying technical, institutional and agricultural innovations. However, vulnerability to climate change has rarely been considered, in spite of the imminent risks due to a higher-than-average warming perspective and the predicted melting of glaciers, which will greatly affect the availability of irrigation water. Using the Khorezm region in the irrigated lowlands of northwest Uzbekistan as an example, we identify the local patterns of vulnerability to climate variability and extremes. We look at on-going environmental degradation, water-use inefficiency, and barriers to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and based on an extensive review of research evidence from the region, we present concrete examples of initiatives for building resilience and improving climate risk management. These include improving water use efficiency and changing the cropping patterns that have a high potential to decrease the exposure and sensitivity of rural communities to climate risks. In addition, changes in land use such as the afforestation of degraded croplands, and introducing resource-smart cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, may strengthen the capacity of farmers and institutions to respond to climate challenges. As these can be out-scaled to similar environments, i.e. the irrigated cotton and wheat growing lowland regions in Central Asia and the Caucasus, these findings may be relevant for regions beyond the immediate geographic area from which it draws its examples. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Aral Sea Basin; Climate risk; Governance; Irrigated agriculture; Transformation countries; Uzbekistan; Vulnerability","Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; soil organic matter; adaptation; afforestation; agricultural worker; agriculture; Asia; climate change; crop; cropland; deglaciation; degradation; ecology; ecosystem; environmental change; food security; government; irrigation (agriculture); plant water use; priority journal; review; rural area; rural population; soil management; Uzbekistan; water availability; water management; water supply","","","","","ZEF; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (0339970A); Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia","This research work was funded by Ca’ Foscari University of Venice .
